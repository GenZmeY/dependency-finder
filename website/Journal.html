	<p>Built a stop condition for the new closure engine and came up with
	the public interface so I can control how many layers it computes.</p>

	<p>Remove all remaining signs of support for object serialization.
	This consisted namely of removing code that used
	<code>java.io.ObjectInputStream</code> to read files and having
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependency.Node</code> not implement
	<code>java.io.Serializable</code> anymore.</p>

	<p>Release the Dependency Finder tutorial at last.  I managed to crop
	all my screen captures in a consistent fashion.  At the last moment, I
	noticed that a tool tip was on one of the GUI captures.  Too bad.</p>

	<p>I started thinking about an OO Metrics tutorial too.  Setting up a
	custom configuration is non-trivial and could use some kind of
	introduction.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 29, 2004
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Removed all support for serialization of the dependency graph.  I
	was never able to deserialize the graphs anyway.  I was semi-useful for
	guesstimating the size of the graph, but <code>DependencyMetrics</code>
	is much better for that.  Serialiazed objects are not forward-
	compatible anyway, so they do not make a good mechanism for
	persistence.</p>

	<p>I started to compress the sample XML files on the project's home
	page.  They were taking up too much space and making me overrun my
	quota over there.</p>
    </dd>

	<p>Did some screen capture for the tutorial.  My previous version had
	crappy mockups in PowerPoint.  I captured the same pictures in both the
	web application and the GUI, but the images are too big (800x600) to
	put in the PowerPoint slides that make up the tutorial.  If I shrink
	them down to make them fit, I cannot make out the details that I need
	to show.  So I will need to crop the important parts out, on all
	images.</p>

	<p>Outfitted the closure engine with an inbound selector in unit
	tests.</p>

	<p>Refactored closure selectors to share common code.  This will also
	help me pass an abstract selector to the engine when calculating
	closures.</p>

	<p>Looked at the bug list and feature request list.  It had been a
	while.  There was one bug request regarding broken links on the web
	site, and two requests for interesting new ways to use JarJarDiff.</p>

	<p>It turns out that I had thought of one such way back on August 19,
	2003.  The idea is to use a dependency graph to list the parts of a
	third party API you are using.  Then feed this list to JarJarDiff to
	limit the hange report to the subset that you are really using.  All
	the tools are there, it's just a matter of how you use them.  I
	scanned my notes and added them to
	<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=900446&group_id=43305&atid=435887x">feature request #900446</a>
	until I come up with a formal description.</p>
    </dd>

    <dd>
	<p>Figured out how to keep the graphs separate while I compute the
	transitive closure.  The selectors and the engine need to keep two
	lists of nodes, one for each graph.  This allows the closure to only
	copy the nodes and dependencies that will make up the closure.</p>

	<p>But I have another problem.  What if class <code>A</code> depends
	on class <code>B</code>, and method <code>foo()</code> of
	<code>B</code> depends on class <code>C</code>.  When I traverse the
	graph to compute the closure, is it reasonable to visit features of
	classes for additional dependencies?</code>  Does <code>A</code>
	transitively depend on <code>C</code> in this case?.  At runtime, it
	would only if <code>foo()</code> is called as a result of interactions
	on with <code>A</code>.  If that were the case, the graph would have a
	path from some feature of <code>A</code> to <code>foo()</code> anyway,
	so maybe the transitive closure engine doesn't need to go the extra
	distance.  I'll think about it some more.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 17, 2004
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>More work on <code>TransitiveClosureEngine</code>.  I'm stuck in the
	selectors and how they navigate the original graph and copy only what's
	needed to the destination graph, all the while keeping track of
	individual layers as I build the closure.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 15, 2004
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Finished the initial step in the new transitive closure algorithm.
	Now, I need to work on each step's processing, where I incrementally
	build the closure, one level at a time.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 14, 2004
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Started working of a <code>NodeSelector</code> to handle the initial
	step of the new transitive closure algorithm.  I need to take a scope
	criteria and traverse the graph, collecting nodes matching the
	closure's starting point as I go.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 12, 2004
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>I have a problem with test-driven development.  People say you can
	use the test suite to document how to use a system; but if I'm new to
	this software, which one of the hundreds of tests should I look at
	first?  I have been toying with the idea of using the dependency graph
	to categorize the tests and maybe provide a order in which to approach
	them.  I wonder if I could use some clever heuristic estimate the
	complexity of a given test.  I would have to start with a test method
	and look at dependencies to other classes and methods in the same
	package.  I don't know what the heuristics would look like, yet.</p>

	<p>I tried to list OO metrics for test classes by using a group
	definition.  I noticed that the group counters for the group I had
	created were all at zero.  It looked strange since the first one is the
	number of public classes and it said zero.  Statistical measurements
	were just fine.  After investigating a bit, I realized the counters are
	incremented by <code>MetricsGatherer</code>, but only for the package
	group of a given class.  My custom group never had a chance.</p>

	<p>I also noticed one more problem.  The statistical measurements at
	the project level take <em>all</em> groups into account, packages and
	user-defined.  This means that SLOC counts some classes more than once,
	for example.  I don't have a solution at this time.</p>

	<p>Adjusted <code>PermissiveDispatcher</code> so it ignores HTML files.
	I also gave it its own unit tests.</p>

	<p>A number of people have been asking about why Dependency Finder does
	not list line numbers where dependencies occur.  I added a section in
	the User Manual that explains how the line number information in
	<code>.class</code> files is so fragmented as to be useless.  I put it
	under the "Limitations" heading.</p>

	<p>Scott Stirling pointed out IBM's SA4J to me.  Apparently, IBM
	acquired SmallWorlds and this is based on the SmallWorlds tool.  It
	would explain why my link to SmallWorlds on the Resource page is
	broken.  Thanks Scott for pluging Dependency Finder in a related
	article on
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.jsp?thread_id=24255">TheServerSide.COM</a>.</p>

	<p>Scott also gave me some feedback on the documentation and submitted
	some improvements.  He's also investigating graphical rendering of
	graphs on his own.  I'll keep you posted.</p>

	<p>I've been reading "UML for Java Programmers" by Robert C. Martin.
	In one chapter, he talks about dependency management and recommends
	using tools to automatically track them in code.  He goes so far as to
	recommend JDepend to readers.  I wonder if he'd recommend Dependency
	Finder too.  Maybe if I add a package-level dependency cycle detection
	feature, it would make the tool even more useful.  At some point, I
	will have to start thinking about going beyond the raw data and have
	the tools do more work when it comes to analyzing design quality
	factors.</p>

	<p>Got started on a <code>TransitiveClosureEngine</code> to handle the
	next version of transitive closures.  The engine should select a
	starting point in the graph and incrementally grow a subgraph from that
	initial set of nodes until some termination criteria is met.  This
	could be that a given node is reached or that a certain number of steps
	have been taken.</p>

	<p>Worked on having XML writers take an optional encoding identifier.
	The default is UTF-8 but may not be enough if some Java identifiers
	contain multibyte characters.  I tried UTF-16, but IE and Xerces had
	trouble with it.  So I'll just let the caller pick something they
	like.</p>

	<p>Fixed <code>ClassReader</code> so it processes multiple
	</code>.class</code> files correctly.  I modified the DTD to allow
	multiple <code>&lt;classfile&gt;</code> tags within an all inclusive
	<code>&lt;classfiles&gt;</code> tag.  I logged it as bug #900938.</p>

	<p>I fixed it immediately as
	<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=900942&group_id=43305&atid=435886">patch #900942</a>.</p>

	<p>Someone has been having a number of issues.  I'll be able to fix
	some of them, but not all.</p>

	<p>First, they analyzed classes with non-ASCII characters in
	identifiers.  For example, a class name or method name that includes an
	"&eacute;" character.  I was surprised that <code>javac</code> will let
	you do such a thing; it turns out this is perfectly legal.  Anyway, the
	encoding for XML output is UTF-8.  XML parsers cannot read the data
	correctly because the characters in the stream do not correspond to the
	UTF-8 encoding.  They would like me to ad an option to specify a custom
	encoding.</p>

	<p>I looked into this an since Dependency Finder simply write out
	String objects, maybe I should simply use Java's default encoding
	instead.  The documentation says this should be UTF-16, but when I try
	it, Xerces complains about byte ordering.  And IE complains about the
	encoding not being supported.  More thought needed.</p>

	<p>Second, the <code>.class</code> file parser throws a
	<code>ClassCastException</code> when it encounters unknown, illegally
	constructed <code>attribute_info</code> structures.  Apparently, this
	was with output from Visual Age for Java.  I logged it as bug
	#900060.</p>

	<p>I fixed it immediately as
	<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=900062&group_id=43305&atid=435886">patch #900062</a>.</p>

	<p>Third, they encountered the situation I described on
	February 03, 2004.  I am starting to think that maybe I should do
	something about it.  But what?</p>

	<p>Fourth, and last, they tried to run <code>ClassReader</code> on a
	whole JAR file.  It is designed for use on one file at a time (in
	spite of what the documentation says), not on a whole codebase.  The
	result is an invalid XML document with repeated DOCTYPE and no root
	tag.  I'll try to fix that tomorrow.</p>

	attention.  It's a graph package for complex graphs that lay themselves
	out.  You can collapse nodes and stretch things around.  It looks very
	cool and maybe I could make use of it in Dependency Finder for some
	kind of rendering of dependency graphs.  I looked at the code on
	SourceForge, but there is no documentation and I don't have the time to
	investigate further right now.  Maybe later...</p>

	<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/">Software Development</a>
	magazine published a piece on open source software in which they

    <dd>
	<p>Someone came up with some weird behavior in Dependency Finder and
	asked me for an explanation.  It turns out to be caused by some
	interesting things done by the Java compiler.  I touched upon it back on
	January 07, 2004, but I'll elaborate further here.</p>

	<p>First, suppose you have the following classes <code>A</code> and
	<code>B</code>:</p>

	<table><tr>
	<td valign="top">
	<pre>
	class B {
	    void b() {}
	}




	class A extends B {
	    void a() {
	        b();
	    }
	}
	</pre>
	</td>
	<td width="150" align="right">
	<img src="images/AandB.gif" />
	</td>
	</tr></table>

	<p>Now, imagine for a second that we have the following class
	<code>C</code>:</p>

	<table><tr>
	<td valign="bottom">
	<pre>
	class C {
	    A a = new A();
	    void foo() {
	        a.b();
	    }
	}
	</pre>
	</td>
	<td width="500" align="right">
	<img src="images/AandBandC.gif" />
	</td>
	</tr></table>

	<p>The compiler resolves the line "<code>a.b()</code>" as a call to
	method <code>b()</code> on object <code>a</code> of type
	<code>A</code>.  The JDK 1.3 compiler will see that method
	<code>b()</code> is actually defined in superclass <code>B</code> of
	class <code>A</code> and will generate bytecode to call
	"<i>method <code>b()</code> in class definition <code>B</code>, or one
	of its superclasses</i>".</p>

	<p>This is fine and dandy as long as nobody overrides <code>b()</code>
	in subclasses of <code>B</code>, like <code>A</code> for instance.
	Imagine that someone overrides <code>b()</code> in <code>A</code> but
	does not recompile <code>C</code>, maybe because this client code was
	developed by someone else and the person making the change is unaware
	of its existence.  Now <code>C</code> will go on calling "<i>method
	<code>b()</code> in class definition <code>B</code></i>", even though
	the instance <code>a</code> is of type <code>A</code> and now has a new
	definition for its method <code>b()</code>.  The compiler said "call
	the method defined in <code>B</code>" and that's what the VM will do.</p>

	<p>So the good people at Sun changed the compiler in JDK 1.4 to use the
	type of the reference instead of where it thinks the method is located.
	The VM will walk the inheritance tree at runtime to find the method.
	So in the JDK 1.4-compiled version of <code>C</code> even if class
	<code>A</code> does not override the method <code>b()</code>, the
	bytecode essentially says to call "<i>method <code>b()</code> in class
	definition <code>A</code>, or one of its superclasses</i>".  Now, even
	if we modify <code>A</code> without recompiling <code>C</code>, the
	method will resolve correctly.</p>

	<p>Let's take a closer look back at class <code>A</code>'s method
	<code>a()</code>.  In reality, it is calling method <code>b()</code>
	on the implicit <code>this</code> variable, which is of type
	<code>A</code>.  So if you compile <code>A</code> with JDK 1.3, it will
	try to call method <code>b()</code> in class <code>B</code>.  If you
	compile it with JDK 1.4, it will try to call method <code>b()</code>
	in class <code>A</code>.</p>

	<img src="images/A.this.gif" />

	<p>Dependency Finder gets its information from the bytecode in the
	compiled Java class.  It provides you with an exact rendition of what
	the compiler did.  In the case of the code above, compiled with JDK
	1.4, it will list a dependency
	<code>A.a()&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;A.b()</code>, even though there may not be
	any method <code>b()</code> in class <code>A</code>.</p>

	<p>Now you may ask "Can't Dependency Finder figure it out and assign
	the dependency to method <code>b()</code> in class <code>B</code>?"
	The answer is no, it can't.  For starters many dependencies go to
	classes that the tool will never see such as classes and features in
	external libraries that may not get analyzed, such as
	<code>rt.jar</code>.  Then, there is the issue of starting to make
	assumptions.  I've resisted the temptation to make any assumptions so
	far.  I would rather have to tools present an unmodified view of
	reality and not run the risk of misleading users with possibly invalid
	assumptions.  Even if this means that results look strange from time to
	time.</p>

	<p>I also had someone else ask me about a launching script for
	JarJarDiff on AS/400.  I have never even seen as AS/400 system, so all
	I could do was to point them to the current Windows and Unix scripts,
	and what it is that the JarJarDiff tool classes do, in the hope that
	they are able to fix it for their system.</p>

	<p>Looking at the release plan, I think I'm a little dispersed right
	now.  I need to focus and get things rolling again.  The holiday break

	going to complete the documentation and fix the dependency closure bugs
	and ship the net release ASAP.</p>

	<p>Turns out the discussion on
	<a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pragprog/">praprog</a> was aimed
	at code analyzers that are part of the language compilers and how they
	traverse parse trees to determine the type of expressions in loosely
	typed languages.  It was not directly related to the work done by
	Dependency Finder, but there were still some interesting ideas.  Like
	Tarjan's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees using depth-first
	search.  It was a good exercise, even if the knowledge will not be
	immediately useful.</p>

	<p>Dependency Finder is three years old!</p>

	<p>I have been thinking some more about tracking inter-JAR
	dependencies.  I could come up with some kind of <code>GroupNode</code>
	that would be the parent of <code>PackageNode</code>.  But this
	assumes that packages are wholly contained in one location, which is
	not necessarily the case.  An alternative would be for groups to be
	made of arbitrary sets of classfiles, kind of like the group
	functionality in <code>OOMetrics</code>, where classes can be part of
	more than one grouping.  Some groups represent packages while others
	could represent JAR files.  Still needs more thought.</p>

	<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pragprog/">praprog</a>
	mailing list had a discussion on dependency cycles and some of the
	theory behind cycle detection and resolution.  Looks like I'll need to

	<p>Started working on a tool to list packages by JAR file in a given
	codebase.  I'm thinking I could turn this into a way to track classes
	by their location, be it a loose class file or as part of a JAR file.
	I have had a few requests for tracking inter-JAR dependencies and this
	could be a step in that direction.</p>

	<p>Yesterday, I forgot to refactor the JSPs to use the new
	<code>SelectionCriteria</code> instead of the previous
	<code>SelectiveTraversalStrategy</code> directly.  Of course, the Ant
	task for compiling JSPs using Jasper has changed between Tomcat 4.1.27
	and Tomcat 5.0.16, so I had to spend a fair amount of time getting my
	custom Ant build script up to stuff.  After that, upgrading the JSPs
	was pretty easy.</p>

	<p>There was a thread on the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pragprog/">praprog</a> mailing
	list about code inspection tools.  At first, I didn't want to mention
	Dependency Finder because the original message asked for tools to
	evaluate code style and unused variables/methods.  Dependency Finder
	can't do much about style, and while it can find elements that are not
	referenced directly, that does not necessarily mean they are not used.
	They could be interface methods or things called via reflection.  But
	then, someone else brought up JDepend, so I had to say something.
	Some of the other tools mentioned:</p>

	<p>I started revamping the dependency closure computations.  First, I
	need to extract node selection logic to its own class and refactor
	<code>SelectiveTraversalStrategy</code> to use the new

	This is getting to be quite an undertaking, but it will help the new
	closure logic figure out starting nodes and stopping conditions.</p>

	<p>There is a nice new feature in Javadoc that Ant 1.6 now makes
	available to me.  The <code>-linksource</code> switch to Javadoc links
	the documentation to the source code.  An HTML-ized version of the
	source files is created alongside the javadocs.  I also saw something
	called either "j2h"  or "java2html" a while back that created
	hyperlinked version of the source code, complete with syntax
	highlighting.  I wonder if I could somehow get to two to work together.
	The links between documentation and source could definitely be useful,
	and the syntax highlighting is quite cool too.</p>

	<p>I hesitated to checking the new version of <code>build.xml</code>
	that uses the <code>linksource</code> attribute to the
	<code>&lt;java&gt;</code> task.  This would require that people upgrade
	to Ant 1.6 just to compile Dependency Finder.  But then again, it is
	only if they try to generate the javadocs, so it shouldn't really be a
	problem.</p>

	<p>Found a reference to Dependency Finder on the

	had mistakenly listed the licensing scheme as GPL when it is actually
	BSD, but it has all been fixed now.  This project is a nice,
	comprehensive list of open source software for the Windows platform.</p>

	<p>I also found someone who listed Dependency Finder in their resume
	under a "tools used" heading.  I will take it as a testimony to the
	broad acceptance and wide adoption of Dependency Finder.  :-)</p>

	<p>Someone asked if I could add the line number where the dependencies
	occur in the dependency graph.  Back on October 31, 2002, I had toyed
	with the idea of modeling each dependency with their own object.  This
	would allow me to collect a lot more data about each dependency, but at
	the cost of massive object creation.  I'm afraid this would impact
	performance too much.  I'll keep thinking about it some more.</p>

	<p>Latest SourceForge tallies show downloads only for old release files:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li><code>release 20020127 of "DependencyFinder.zip"</code></li>
	    <li><code>release 20020127 of "DependencyFinder.src.zip"</code></li>
	    <li><code>release 20020711 of "DependencyFinder.war"</code></li>
	</ul>

	<p>These coincide with the first time these names were used, when I
	removed the release label from the file names.  I suspect that some new
	logic for tallying downloads at SourceForge looks at filename now
	instead of what maybe used to be either a combination of release ID and
	filename or some form of file ID.</p>

	<p>Actually, looking at the links on the download page, the links for
	the various <code>DependencyFinder.zip</code> files are identical.  I
	wonder what people are downloading?  The most recent file or one from
	over 18 months ago?  A quick download at least reassured me that they
	are indeed sending the most recent file, but that's regardless of which
	link I click.  I cannot download any of the previous versions; I always
	end up with the most recent file.</p>

	<p>So I always download the <i>most recent</i> file by a given name,
	but the download gets tallied with the <i>oldest</i> file by that name.
	Strange.  I hope this is temporary and the SourceForge people fix this
	soon.  Otherwise, I'll have to reinstate the version label in the
	filenames (which might actually not be a bad idea).</p>

	<p>Researched how inherited methods are represented in compiled code.
	Method access is resolved based on the type of the object reference
	through which the call is made.  In the case of a concrete class
	calling its inherited methods, it does so against the <code>this</code>
	implicit variable which is typed to the concrete class itself.  Hence,
	all the dependencies are to the concrete versions of the methods.</p>

	<p>Here, JDK 1.3 and JDK 1.4 differ slightly.  In JDK 1.3, the
	compiler would resolve method calls to where the methods are defined in
	the inheritance hierarchy.  In JDK 1.4, the calls are resolved to the
	lowest point in the inheritance hierarchy.  This allows redefinition of
	the method in subsequent versions of subclasses, where appropriate.
	With the JDK 1.3 compiled class, it would have to be recompiled to
	benefit from the new definitions.</p>

	<p>False alarm.  They reinstalled the latest version of Dependency
	Finder and it now works just fine.  I am extremely relieved to hear
	this.  I was not looking forward to tracking weird flushing bugs.</p>

	<p>Created a patch for fixing the long names for <code>IEPM</code>
	and <code>OEPF</code> and published it as

	<p>Fixed Ant tasks that are subclasses of <code>GraphTask</code> to
	accept multiple graphs.  Like <code>&lt;javac&gt;</code> and others,
	you can use either the <code>srcfile</code> attribute or a nested
	<code>&lt;src&gt;</code> element, or you can even use both.  It uses a
	path-like structure, but I wanted to use a <code>FileSet</code>
	instead.  You cannot really provide a directory, you have to specify
	XML files.  But as I was editing the documentation, I came upon tasks
	that are subclasses of <code>FileSet</code> and can have nested
	<code>&lt;include&gt;</code> elements.  I'll have to look into doing
	something similar instead of what I did just now.</p>

	<p>I wanted to look at the size of serialized graphs to compare full
	graphs to class-to-class graphs.  The way references are handled in
	serialized graphs is closer to how it's handled in memory than my own
	XML format.  But I ran into a stack overflow situation when I tried
	to serialize this one graph.  This whole idea of serializing graphs is
	just getting worse and worse.</p>

	<p>Well, it didn't work out.  They tried to break down their codebase
	but all their <code>DependencyReporter</code> output is either of
	size zero or badly truncated.</p>

	<p>Back in July, I had problems with truncated files, but back then it
	was because <code>java.io.Writer</code> instances were not being closed.
	I removed all calls to <code>java.io.Writer.flush()</code> because the
	stream is supposed to be automatically flushed when it is closed.  It
	has worked just well for me since then and I am troubled that they
	should be having these kinds of problems.</p>

	<p>They gave me a copy of their codebase to try and recreate the
	problem, but it worked fine for me.  I'm down to thinking maybe it's
	because they're on Linux, for some reason.  But that can't be it.</p>

	<p>As I was working out their problem, I realized how great it is to
	have <code>DependencyReporter</code> to merge graphs together.  I can
	give it as many graphs as I want and it can combine them all
	together.  I noticed the Ant task version doesn't do that; it can
	only take a single graph at a time.  I'll need to fix that.</p>

	<p>I fixed measurements IEPM's and OEPF's long name.  Now, I'll need

	<p>That one customer with the large codebase and low memory still has
	problems.  They had tried <code>OOMetrics</code> without much success.
	The dependency-related measurement proved too hard to figure out
	right.  I really need to do something about them.</p>

	<p>So, they need to count dependencies between classes.</p>

	<p>One approach is to use the dependency counts from
	<code>OOMetrics</code>.  The downside  is that it uses an
	<code>AggregatingClassfileLoader</code> to load all the class
	structures before making any measurements.  Some measurements attempt
	to traverse multiple classes and the tool must make sure they are
	present in memory at that time.</p>

	<p>Another option is to use <code>DependencyExtractor</code> to extract
	a dependency graph first, and then get the information from it.
	<code>DependencyExtractor</code> uses a
	<code>TransientClassfileLoader</code> and discards each class structure
	as soon as it's gotten the dependency information it needs.  The memory
	requirements are much less.</p>

	<p>But for a large codebase, the resulting graph can still be quite
	large.  If you are really restrained memory-wise, it may still be too
	much.  My customer was trying to run <code>DependencyExtractor</code>
	to create one large graph and then reduce it with <code>c2c</code>.
	Since all they needed were class-to-class dependencies, we figured they
	could run <code>DependencyExtractor</code> multiple times on subsets of
	the codebase, run <code>c2c</code> on the resulting graph subsets, and
	finally recombine the now much smaller class-to-class graphs.  After
	trying this with <code>DependencyFinder.jar</code>, it turned out that
	the class-to-class graph reduced complexity by 98% compared to the
	equivalent extracted graph.  I'm anxious to see if this worked for
	them.</p>

	<p>Someone has been trying to analyze a large codebase with limited
	memory.  They're interested in counting class-level dependencies and
	have been using <code>DependencyReporter</code> to reduce the graph and
	then count inbound and outbound dependencies.  I suggested they use
	<code>OOMetrics</code> instead.  It has a whole group of oddly named
	measurements (OEP, IIPM, etc.) that already track dependencies.  As I
	was reviewing them especially in the context of
	<code>MartinConfig.xml</code>, I realized they were kind of cryptic and
	I need to document what each one does and how you can combine them to
	arrive at the counts you're interested in.</p>

	<p>I noticed that measurement IEPM and OEPF had the wrong long name.
	They said "Extra-Class" when they are actually "Extra-Package".</p>

	<p>Steve Kirk sent me his <code>rt.jar</code> file.  I tried
	<code>ClassList</code> on it with logging turned on to see exactly
	where it fails.  I also discovered
	"<code>javap -c <i>classname</i></code>" which dumps the instruction
	sequence for each method.  I compared the sequence from my logs with the
	one from <code>javap</code> to see if I'm interpreting the bytecode
	correctly.</p>

	<p>It turns out the class
	<code>com.jeantessier.classreader.Instruction</code> had the wrong
	size the instruction "<code>fstore</code>".  It listed it as 1 byte when
	it is really 2 bytes.  This threw off the bytecode reader and eventually
	led to some runtime exception that crashed the program.  I have fixed it

	<p>Someone brought <a target="_blank" href="http://nounit.sourceforge.net/">NoUnit</a>

	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> to get a method call
	graph.  I guess they then use logic similar to dependency closures to
	figure out if methods are called directly from unit tests or if
	indirectly, how many degrees are they removed from the tests.  Since
	they only analyze <code>.class</code> files and then use XSL transforms
	for rendering the information, they cannot take into account
	conditional logic.  As far as I can see, the information can only be an
	educated guess at best.  I think you'd be better off using a code
	coverage tool like Clover or jcoverage to run the tests.  Maybe	NoUnit
	can give a quick estimate since you don't need to run the tests, and

	<p>I was about to say that if the project is small enough, you can
	always do the jar-to-jar analysis manually with the help of some

	<p>There are a number of problems:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>There are quite a few packages and a lot of repeated information.
	If some JARs are quite obvious, like <code>ant.jar</code>,
	</code>jakarta-oro.jar</code>, and </code>log4j.jar</code>, it is not
	clear where "<code>org.xml.*</code>" would come from.  I'm thinking
	that the JVM would probably get them from its
	<code>BOOTCLASSPATH</code>.</li>
	<p />
	<li>It the tool analyzes <code>A.jar</code>, it will find dependencies
	on packages outside of <code>A.jar</code>.  It would then be quite
	difficult, maybe impossible, to find out in which JARs these extra
	packages are located.  The tool would need a mapping of packages to
	JAR;  this mapping would preferably be generated automatically but some
	other tool.</li>
	<p />
	<li>It is possible to put two classes of a same package in two separate
	JARs.  This means that the tool would have to work at the class level
	instead of that of packages.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I'm sorry there is no obvious answer to this problem, but I will
	keep thinking about it.  In the meantime, there are some tools on the
	Internet that track jar-to-jar dependencies.  Just google it.  :-)</p>

	<p>Svetlin Stanchev brought up the idea of having the web application
	produce HTML instead of pre-formatted text.  I already have an
	unscheduled task for this, so now I must decide whether or not to move
	it forward.  I could use a dedicated <code>Printer</code> subclass,
	like I do for text rendering.  This has the disadvantage of
	duplicating the logic of rendering a dependency graph to a Java class
	and an XSL transformation.  But I already did it for the text form, so
	there is a precedent ...  I'm just not sure it really is a good

	<p>Fixed <code>MaximumCapacityPatternCache</code>.  It turns out that
	<code>Perl5Util</code> use a second cache internally which is
	initialized with the pattern cache's capacity.  This additional cache
	pre-allocates memory proportionally to the capacity, in my case
	proportionally to <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, or about 2 billions.
	I changed my cache to use a hard-coded value of 20.  That should be
	enough to keep things going.</p>

	<p>I added my new cache in a few other <code>Perl5Util</code> instances
	where they might run into many regular expressions.  I had to create a
	new package, <code>com.jeantessier.text</code> for the ORO-related
	class.</p>

	<p>Added <code>xml-apis.jar</code> and <code>xercesImpl.jar</code> to
	the web application's WAR file.</p>

	<p>Svetlin Stanchev requested a variation of the web application that
	can read in a dependency graph saved as an XML document.  This way,
	one can build on one machine, including generating the graph, and only
	copy the graph to the web server machine instead of copying all the
	classes resulting from the compilation.  It sounded like a good idea
	and so I added <code>load.jsp</code> to do just that.  I might have to
	redesign the footer a little and the web app's parameters.  One
	drawback is that in order to read the XML document, the web application
	needs an XML parser.  This means I need to add Xerces to the web app,
	bumping up the WAR file's size considerably.</p>

	<p>By configuring Log4J correctly, Svetlin Stanchev took graph
	extraction from 6 hours down to 10 minutes.  I'm happy about that.</p>

	<p>I was trying to analyze the main JAR file of Together Control
	Center as an example of working with a large piece of software (i.e.,
	with a huge number of classes).  I didn't get very far because one
	of the classes in the JAR appeared corrupted and broke the whole
	<code>.class</code> file loading process.  I adjusted
	<code>ClassfileLoaderEventSource</code> so it can skip single,
	malformed classes without aborting everything.  It turns out they used
	an obfuscator and it added a text file with a <code>.class</code>
	extension, fooling Dependency Finder ginto trying to parse it like a
	regular <code>.class</code> file with bytecode in it.</p>

	<p>I gave a shot at <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=825582&group_id=43305&atid=435887">Feature Request 825582</a>,
	the one about the pattern cache for <code>Perl5Util</code>.  I tried
	to build a cache based on a simple <code>HashMap</code> with
	"unlimited" capacity, but when I use it in
	<code>SelectiveTraversalStrategy</code>, I get a bunch of
	<code>OutOfmemoryError</code> even from seemingly unrelated areas of
	the code.  More later...</p>

	<p>As I was preparing a reply to the original call for help, I noticed
	that whether or not Log4J is configured properly can have a huge impact
	on the performance of the tasks.  In one test, running
	<code>DependencyExtractor</code> on Dependency Finder itself took over
	7 minutes with the missing Log4J configuration versus 14 <b>seconds</b>
	with the configuration that ships with Dependency Finder.  So if you
	find that Dependency Finder is a little unresponsive, you might want

	<code>StopX()</code> to <code>BeginX()</code> and <code> EndX()</code>
	respectively.  This way, all events follow the same convention.  It
	could impact people who developed on top of Dependency Finder, I'll

	<p>Someone tried to run a dependency query with an exclusion list that
	had over 10,000 regular expressions!  On a sizeable codebase, the whole
	thing took about 13 hours.  They dug around a bit and found that
	<code>Perl5Util</code> only caches 20 regular expressions at a time by
	default.  Their query was taking forever because the ORO engine was
	constantly recompiling regular expressions.  They entered
	<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=825582&group_id=43305&atid=435887">Feature Request 825582</a>
	at SourceForge.net to request some way to adjust the caching
	configuration for <code>Perl5Util</code>.</p>

	<p>I added a <code>-version</code> switch to most CLI tools.  It
	prints version information from the JAR file's manifest and then exits
	the tool.</p>

	<p>I have a problem with some of the tools that require some mandatory
	switches, such as <code>ClassClassDiff</code> and
	<code>JarJarDiff</code>.  The command-line parser throws an exception
	when the mandatory switches are missing, therefore bypassing any
	further processing.  Right now, I can't do anything about it and the
	user must provide the mandatory switches to see the version output.  I
	see one possible way to handle it.  The parser could throw a different
	type of exception when mandatory switches are missing.  The caller
	could catch the exception and still inspect the command-line for the
	<code>-version</code> switch.  If it is present, the caller could then
	print version data instead of usage data.</p>

	unrelated party working on proprietary code that they can't show me,

	didn't want to be bothered.  So if anybody out there ever sees this

	<p>For a while, I had thought about modifying <code>OOMetrics</code> to

	all three formats at the same time.  And I could do the same thing with
	other tools than generate multiple output formats.  I finally decided
	against.  There is very little value in this feature and it would need
	broad sweeping changes in the way tools interpret command-line
	arguments, such as figuring out the extension for the output filename.

	<p>Someone wrote to me saying they had problems with

	<p>Back when I was preparing version 1.0, I toyed with the idea of

	<p>Interestingly, I had CLI's <code>VerboseListener</code> extend from

	rather interesting experience.  Let this be a lesson against inheriting
	implementation.  Incidentally, the other candidates for extending

	<p>Someone has mentioned that API diff reports still list modified

	still part of your supported API until it is completely removed.  As

	library are likely to still be using the class.</p>

	<p>I had to explode the <code>ClassfileLoader</code> instances to show
	how the behavior is spread across the inheritance hierarchy.  This

	responsible for one and only one thing.</p>

	<p>Started coding <code>BeginFile</code> and <code>EndFile</code>

	<p>When extracting from ZIP or JAR files, the progress reports always
	fall short of 100%.  I realized that this is because the size estimates
	include directory entries and non-<code>.class</code> files.  The
	progress function only counts <code>.class</code> files, and therefore
	always comes up short a bit.  So I have added two new load-time events
	for when the <code>ClassfileLoader</code> start on a file, regardless
	of its extension, and when it is done with a file.  These events occur
	before and after the <code>BeginClassfile</code> and
	<code>EndClassfile</code> respectively.</p>

	<p>I thought of a new way to use <code>JarJarDiff</code>.  So far, I
	have talked about how you can use it as a producer of software
	libraries to monitor the evolution of the published interface you
	expose.  But another usage is as a consumer of software libraries,
	where you want to know if a new version of the library introduced
	changes on the part of the library that you use.  I am putting
	together detailed instructions on how to use Dependency Finder to
	automatically compute which part of the third-party library you are
	using and use this information to filter the output of
	<code>JarJarDiff</code>.  More on this later.</p>

	<p>Added a <code>BeanInfo</code> helper class to the
	<code>Version</code> class.  This way, I can use
	<code>&lt;jsp:getProperty&gt;</code> tags in JSPs and not have to call
	my accessors <code>getX()</code> and <code>setX()</code>.  It works on
	Tomcat, but I remember having problems with using <code>BeanInfo</code>
	with other application servers in the past.  I just hope they have made
	progress since.</p>

	<p>I found a bug (#789373) with using the XSL stylesheet
	<code>PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl</code> from Ant with the
	<code>&lt;xslt&gt;</code> task.  I will have to investigate, but I
	should really rewrite that entire stylesheet so it complies with proper
	XSL rules.  In the meantime, people can use the
	<code>&lt;java&gt;</code> task to run Xalan's XSL processor,
	<code>org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process</code>, instead.  Just make sure
	you set <code>fork="yes"</code> on the task's attributes so that JDK
	1.3 VMs pick up the Xalan JAR file.  The bug report has a sample Ant
	build file that shows how to do it.  I will also add it to the
	documentation eventually.</p>

	<p>Ran <code>JarJarDiff</code> on Xerces and Xalan for the latest

	<p>Moved the version stuff to its own class, but since it reads
	information from its JAR file's manifest, I cannot find a way to test
	it properly.  The good news is that with its no-args constructor, I
	can use it in JSPs with the &lt;jsp:useBean&gt; tag.  Next, I will
	outfit the CLI tools with a <code>-version</code> switch.  And maybe
	I can even get an "About" box for the GUI.</p>

	<p>On the downside, I am not too sure where to put this new class.  It
	is in the new package <code>com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder</code>,
	soon to be joined by tools to group the cut and pasted code that ends
	up duplicated between the CLI, the GUI, the JSPs, and the Ant tasks.
	I might even go as far as creating custom tags for the JSPs, or at
	least JavaBeans for the parameters to the query, closure, and
	dependency metrics engines.</p>

	<p>I created a feature request to address the start scripts for Unix
	(#787904).  Since I don't have an environment setup to develop and
	tests and package on Unix (yet), I am going to leave these scripts in a
	patch for now. These scripts don't use the contribution from Jonathan
	Doughty because I am not done studying it, yet.  More on this later.</p>

	<p>Figured a way to get at the information in the JAR file's
	<code>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> entry.  I now use it in the web
	application's JSPs to generate the "Powered by ..." branding with a URL
	back to the Dependency Finder website.  I will soon refactor it into a
	class I can use with <code>-version</code> switches in the CLI and in
	an About box in the GUI.</p>

	<p>I tried to use
	<code>getClass().getResourceAsStream("/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF")</code>,
	but the classloader has to defer to its parent first, before it tries
	to resolve anything.  So I always go the manifest for the JDK itself.
	I had to get the resource URL for the class itself first, and parse it
	to extract the path to the JAR file instead, and extract its manifest
	via the <code>java.util.jar</code> package.</p>

	<p>For Xalan, I used  the distribution with two JAR files,
	<code>xalan.jar</code> and <code>xsltc.jar</code>.  I don't need the
	material in the second one, so I only ship <code>xalan.jar</code> and
	this keeps the size of the distribution down.</p>

	<p>Published patch for choosing between a <code>GraphCopier</code> and
	a <code>GraphSummarizer</code> when running dependency queries.  This
	new patch (#784040) replaces two previous ones (#776154 and #776161)
	and also fixes a bug in <code>ClassReader</code> where it sent its
	<code>Printer</code> to the output stream and generated erroneous XML
	data.</p>

	<p>Found that <code>StatisticalMeasurement.CollectData()</code> was
	both <code>synchronized</code> <b>and</b> had a
	<code>synchronized</code> block inside that synchronized on
	<code>this</code>.  This being redundant, I removed the synchronization
	in the method signature and kept the internal block.  This way, it runs
	a tinny bit faster when the data set has not changed.</p>

	<code>GraphCopier</code> to answer queries.  This is useful if you
	want a class-to-class graph with only inheritance, for instance.  I
	still have to document this new feature in the manuals.</p>

	<p>I added navigation controls to <code>extract.jsp</code>.  I was
	tired of always editing the URL to go to the query JSP after
	extracting a graph.  The navigation is the same as on the other JSPs
	and I adjusted the title at the top of the page to match that of the

	<p>Thanks to Jonathan Doughty, who donated a Unix shell script for
	launching the tools in Dependency Finder.  I haven't had the time to
	look at it yet, but I am curious about how he got around to doing it.</p>

	<p>Incidentally, for those who wonder, the main reason I don't have a
	Unix version of the scripts is not that I don't know how to write them,
	but it is that I don't have a convenient environment to build and to
	test them.  I was thinking of Bourne shell scripts
	(<code>/bin/sh</code>) that could discover
	<code>DEPENDENCYFINDER_HOME</code> from their invocation path and figure
	out the exact name of the class to invoke from their invocation name.
	I have a prototype on the SourceForge shell server that dates back to
	January 23, but I cannot build a <code>.tar.gz</code> file with symbolic
	links in it on my Windows machine, and I don't want to distribute my
	build process either.  And working via that dreadful SSH terminal is out
	of the question.  I need three or four launchers to handle the various
	patterns in scripts, and symbolic links to create all the scripts.
	Since I cannot create the symbolic links at build-time on my Windows
	machine, I might have to write a quick install script that creates all
	the symbolic links to each launcher.  Running it would become part of
	the installation process.  Jonathan Doughty took a slightly different
	approach, so I look forward to comparing what he did with what I had in
	mind.  Maybe I can get a patch together while we wait for the next
	release...</p>

	<p>I had put the wrong patch file in patch #776104.  I was able to
	recreate the correct file and upload it to SourceForge.  Luckily, this
	patch was very minor and did not address anything that was broken; it
	simply removed redundant calls to
	<code>java.io.PrintWriter.flush()</code>.  I actually considered
	removing the patch altogether and keep the fix for a release.  Maybe I
	will change my mind again at some point in the future.  :-)</p>

	<p>Someone found a bug with <code>DependencyReporter</code>.  It does
	not close its <code>PrintWriter</code> and ends up truncating the
	output.  I created a patch for it, after verifying that it was the only
	tool experiencing this problem.</p>

	<p>I also created a patch for the "refresh" button (a.k.a. "reload") on
	<code>DependencyFinder</code>.</p>

	<p>I also created a patch for the clean up of calls to
	<code>flush()</code> from a while ago.</p>

	<p>I cleaned up some indentation text.  There were still places where
	there were four spaces instead of <code>TAB</code> characters.</p>

	<p>About the whole optionally using a <code>GraphCopier</code> thing,
	I have been thinking that this functionality really belongs to the
	advanced controls and I don't need to clutter the simple controls with
	it.</p>

	<p>The GUI could really benefit from a "reload" button.  I keep

	<p>Suppose you place a query against a dependency graph.  You only want
	to see class-to-class dependencies.  If a method is class A calls a
	method in class B, but class A does not refer to class B directly,
	there is an implicit dependency <code>A&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;B</code> but
	not an explicit dependency <code>A&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;B</code>.  99% of
	the time, you want to see the implicit dependency.  But on rare
	occasions, you don't.  Is that justification enough to add a switch to
	the user experience to show only explicit dependencies?  The code is
	already written; it means using a <code>GraphCopier</code> instead of
	a <code>GraphSummarizer</code> to perform the query.  This is what the
	tools do when the graph is maximized anyway.  I think I'll sit on this
	one a little while longer.  I can always use
	<code>DependencyExtractor</code> and look at the raw output for the
	rare times I don't want to see implicit dependencies.</p>

	<p>Someone is having problems with <code>JarJarDiff</code> when their

	It will have to wait until I return.  The problem seems related to
	the <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> file, so maybe if they rename the files

	<p>Minor correction in the documentation of Ant tasks.  When defining

	I will be back around the 4th of July.  I still have a patch to
	produce before that.  I will do a 1.0.1 release upon my return.</p>

	<p>I have been struggling with rewriting the JSPs and break them up
	into headers and footers and navigation pages.  Maybe even use tags
	for the processing and JavaBeans for the request parameters.  One
	argument against doing this is that the JSPs provide examples of how
	to use the classes in Dependency Finder.  I'm not fully decided yet.</p>

    <dd>
	<p>This is my luck.  The day after the 1.0 Release I find a number of
	oversights.</p>

	<p>First, <code>OOMetrics</code> still tries to print its printer.
	This made sense when the printers contained a <code>StringBuffer</code>
	and returned the text as part of their <code>toString()</code>
	method.  But now, they print directly to the output stream and don't
	have a <code>toString()</code> method anymore.  The output now has
	weird strings in odd places, which actually breaks the XML output.</p>

	<p>Second, the version information in the JAR file's manifest is the
	stripped version: "10" instead of "1.0".  I added additional properties
	in <code>build.xml</code> to handle CVS vs. version labels.</p>

	<p>Third, some classes call <code>flush()</code> on streams before
	closing them, and others don't.  The documentation says this is
	redundant, so I removed all of these calls.</p>

	<p>Added "Powered by ..." statement to all the JSPs.  This also gave me
	an occasion to do minor touch ups in the HTML.</p>

	<p>I realized that I ran <code>OOMetrics</code> on non-debug code
	yesterday when I gathered metrics for the 1.0 release.  This means that
	SLOC metrics are way off.  I'll have to figure a way to recompile that
	version and rerun <code>OOMetrics</code>.</p>

	<p>I have been thinking about an installer that would generate all the
	<code>.bat</code> files and adjust them for Windows 98 vs. Windows NT
	and JDK 1.3 vs. JDK 1.4.  I cannot use Perl because the machine where
	you want to install it might not have Perl installed.  I cannot write
	the installer as a DOS script either because string substitution would
	just be too hard, or the Windows 98 version is quite limiting.  But I
	could make it as a simple Java program.  And this way, it could figure
	out the JVM version by itself, and even the OS from system properties.
	Unless I have an epiphany, I won't delay the 1.0 release for this;
	it'll go in the next release.</p>

	<p>Ad hoc testing of the printer modification show that the memory

	<p>I added a new tool to the web app to provide dependency metrics the
	same way that the CLI and the GUI do.  I also added navigation controls
	to move between graphs, closures, and metrics.  In the process, I moved
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependency.MetricsReport</code> to a

	<p>Someone mentioned they are running out of memory when extracting
	dependencies from large JAR files.  This is because the various
	printers use internal <code>StringBuffer</code> instances that grow as
	the graph gets rendered.  I need to take one more look at using
	character streams instead, like I mentioned on March 12th.</p>

	<p>I went ahead and modified
	<code>com.jeantessier.classreader.Printer</code>,
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependency.Printer</code>, and
	<code>com.jeantessier.metrics.Printer</code> to take a
	<code>java.io.PrintWriter</code> instead of their

	<p>I have been thinking about adding another set of JSPs to the web

	I am also thinking of putting in a navigation structure to switch
	between the query, closure, and now the metrics tools.  I would also
	like to pass the parameters around so you can run a query in
	<code>query.jsp</code> and click on "metrics" to get the dependency
	metrics relating to the subgraph issued from the query: number and type
	of nodes, number of dependencies, etc.  I might put it in the 1.0
	release if it does not take too long to do.  Now, all I need to do is
	figure out how to render a nice navigation structure.</p>

	<p>I have also been toying with the idea of a second web app to provide
	the functionality of <code>OOMetrics</code>.  I'm still not clear if a
	separate web app is really required.  The main difference between the
	two is that the current <code>extract.jsp</code> does not hold on to
	parsed </code>.class</code> files.  It discards them as soon as it has
	extracted their dependencies.  The metrics tools read everything in
	first and then go about their business.  So the memory footprint is
	larger, which might become problematic.</p>

	<code>com.jeantessier.commandline</code> package.  I had kept the
	<code>main()</code> method on <code>CommandLine</code> as a sample,
	but it started to bug me.  So I replaced it with actual written
	documentation, both in Javadoc and in the developer guide.</p>

	<p>Memorial Day has come and gone and I was too busy with other things
	to spend much time with Dependency Finder, let alone do the 1.0
	release as I had hoped.  In the meantime, the number of daily
	downloads is still at zero; I must get this release out quickly so the
	downloads start up again.</p>

	<p>Made some minor renaming in the
	<code>com.jeantessier.commandline</code> package.</p>

	<p>It is interesting that since I announced I might do the 1.0 release
	imminently, there has been no downloads of Dependency Finder.  I would
	like to think that the world is standing still, waiting for this 1.0
	release.  :-)</p>

	<p>Worked on the design for the new closure calculator.  It will be a
	little more structured and keep track of each layer as the closure is
	expanded.  This way, I should be able to print actual paths instead of
	just dumping the graph and let users figure it out.  I will also be
	able to use this calculator in finding the shortest path between two
	groups of elements (packages, classes, and/or features).</p>

	<p>I haven't heard anything about the ongoing beta trial, except for
	the nasty problem with the ZIP file.  I'm thinking of closing the beta
	and release 1.0 over the upcoming Memorial Day weekend (this weekend).
	I'll see.</p>

	<p>I have been looking at the
	<a target="_blank" href="clover/">output</a> from
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecortex.net/clover">Clover</a>.
	It includes a few metrics, such as:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>Number of classes</li>
	    <li>Number of methods</li>
	    <li>Lines of code (LOC)</li>
	    <li>Non-comment lines of code (NCLOC)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is interesting to compare them to the metrics from
	<code>OOMetrics</code>.  First, the number of classes are the same.
	But this is where the similarities end.</p>

	<p>Second, Clover counts the number of methods explicitly defined in
	the source code.  Dependency Finder counts all methods in the compiled
	<code>.class</code> file, which includes default constructors added
	by the compiler and <i>synthetic</i> methods.  So the Dependency
	Finder count ends up being slightly higher than Clover's count.</p>

	<p>Third, Clover's LOC counts all lines in a file, indiscriminate of
	whether the line is code, a comment, or even empty.  Its NCLOC count
	limits itself to lines that actually contain code, but it includes
	lines with non-executable code, such as a single closing curly brace
	(i.e., '<code>}</code>').  Dependency Finder's SLOC uses information
	from the compiler, when it is run with the <code>-g</code> switch, to
	count the number of lines with really executable code.  It then adds a
	few more lines to account for class, field, and method declarations.
	It overshoots a little because it even counts implicit constructors and
	<code>synthetic</code> elements, but it stays in the ballpark.</p>

	<p>Overall, it is just curious that Dependency Finder comes up with

	<p>Finally got around to running
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecortex.net/clover">Clover</a>
	on Dependency Finder.  Overall coverage is at 52.2%.  About 16 tests
	in the <code>com.jeantessier.metrics</code> package failed because the
	code instrumentation from Clover messed with the expected metrics.  I
	have put the preliminary results
	<a target="_blank" href="clover/">here</a>.  I can move the tests for
	<code>com.jeantessier.commandline</code> package from the
	<code>main()</code> methods to proper JUnit tests.  That should raise
	coverage somewhat.  I'll look further into Clover for what else I can
	get from it.</p>

	<p>I came across someone who was actually trying to extend Dependency
	Finder.  This person had downloaded the source code, modified the
	classes directly, and recompiled Dependency Finder with the
	modifications.  While this might have seemed like a good idea, it
	will create problems later on when I release an upgrade to Dependency
	Finder and this person will have to merge their custom changes with the
	new version of the files.  It would be much better if they had put
	their custom code in separate classes, in their own custom packages,
	and compiled them against <code>DependencyFinder.jar</code>.  When a
	new version of Dependency Finder comes along, they can just drop it
	in.</p>

    <dd>
	<p>Updated the samples to add 1.0 beta data.</p>

	<p>I had been having problems with the ZIP files that come out of the
	builds.  For some reason, I could not see their contents using WinZIP
	and could not extract them.  Other tools, such as <code>unzip</code>,
	<code>jar</code>, and even Emacs did not have any trouble.  For some
	time, I thought this was a problem between Java-generated ZIP files
	and WinZIP 8.1.  It turns out that Ant was the culprit.  They even had
	an open bug report about it.  It got fixed in the latest release, but
	it is too late for the 1.0 beta release.  I hope people can make do
	with <code>jar</code> for the duration of the beta.  Future releases
	will work with WinZIP as expected.</p>

	<p>Upgraded the following development components:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Ant</td>
	        <td>:</td>
		<td>1.5.2</td>

	<p>Finished the documentation.  I added a section for contributors.
	For now, I feel very paternal about Dependency Finder and I am not
	quite ready to give up control.  I guess I'm more on the <i>cathedral</i>
	than the <i>bazaar</i> side of things.  For those who don't get it, it
	just means I can be quite stuck up.  :-)</p>

	<p>I will be releasing the 1.0 beta shortly.  Stay tuned.</p>

    <dd>
	<p>Started playing with a code coverage tool.  They gave me a free
	license because Dependency Finder is open source.  So far, it looks
	interesting; it consists of Ant tasks to instrument code and gather
	measurements.  Check it out on the 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecortex.net/clover">Clover website</a>.
	I'll publish the coverage report for Dependency Finder when I have
	one.</p>

	<p>It turns out the problem with Ant's &lt;xslt&gt; is well known.  It
	is a bug with the version of Xalan that ships with JDK 1.4.1.  To fix
	it, you have to upgrade the JDK's Xalan; the best way of doing this is
	with the <code>java.endorsed.dir</code> property.  I'll document it
	in more details either in a bug or on the help discussion board.</p>

	<p>Dependency Finder is starting to show up on Java indexing sites.
	Just do a search for "<i>depfind</i>" and find out for yourself.</p>

	<p>I have been trying to add Dependency Finder tasks to the build
	file, but Ant's &lt;xslt&gt; tasks has problems with some of the XSL
	transformations.  At least <code>DependenciesToHTML</code> generates
	and error about "not enough DTMs", whatever that means.  I can still
	run the transform with the CLI script, so I will have to investigate
	some more.</p>

	<p>I just need to add a legend to the diagrams for
	<code>JarJarDiff</code> and write up the project's policy regarding
	code contributions.  Then I can release the beta.</p>

	<p>Took a break for a few days, but now I'm back and bent on getting

	features between the CLI, GUI, Ant tasks, and web app.  I don't know
	quite where to put it.  One place might be as part of each tool
	description in the tools docs, but that spreads it a little too much.
	I might just go with a table in the manual instead.</p>

	<p>After this, I should be done.  The Beta is near!</p>

	<p>Introduced a new tool, <code>ClassClassDiff</code>, which compares
	two classes, even if they don't have the same name.  I found a need
	for it when a renamed one class to work on temporarily and wanted

	<p>Jeff Harman asked questions about dependency visitors and such,
	which prompted me to document that control flow a little more.  I'll
	add the new information to the fledgling developer guide when I get
	a change and when I can find a decent (free) editor for UML diagrams.</p>

	<p>Had some ideas about correlating project size and complexity
	and estimating each via the current metrics.  I might be able to
	do something about complexity with a combination of intra-class,
	intra-package, and extra-package dependencies at both the class
	and method levels.</p>

    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Gave some more thought to having <code>Printer</code> work off a
	<code>java.io.Writer</code> instead of a <code>StringBuffer</code>.
	This would lessen the burden on memory by streaming large graphs
	straight to file or output stream, but the character conversion might
	add processing overhead.  The design below separates formatting of the
	text by <code>DecoratorPrinter</code> from how that text is actually
	saved by <code>FilePrinter</code> and <code>StringPrinter</code>.  The
	latter behaves like the current <code>Printer</code> so I can compare
	both approaches.  But beyond that, it makes little sense since I could
	just as easily pass a <code>java.io.StringWriter</code> to the
	decorator.</p>

	<p><img src="images/DecoratorPrinter.jpg" /></p>
	
	<p>This first scenario shows saving to a file.  Saving to an output
	stream would look just the same.</p>

	<p><img src="images/DecoratorPrinterFileScenario.jpg" /></p>
	
	<p>This second scenario saves the graph to an in-memory string, though
	I could just as easily do the same with a
	<code>java.io.StringWriter</code>.</p>

	<p><img src="images/DecoratorPrinterStringScenario.jpg" /></p>
	
	<p>This design looks like overkill, since <code>FilePrinter</code> and
	<code>StringPrinter</code> end up with empty implementations for their
	<code>VisitX()</code> methods.  In fact, they don't even need to be
	related to <code>Visitor</code> at all since they are not accessed
	directly by the client code.  If I am going to define a new interface
	for them, I might as well simply use <code>java.io.Writer</code>.</p>
	
	<p>I will probably just replace the <code>StringBuffer</code> in
	<code>Printer</code> with a <code>java.io.Writer</code> and be done
	with it.</p>

	<p><em>I'm not too happy with the way the sequence diagrams came out
	too, but that's the fault of the tool I've been using.  And even the
	class diagram has undesireable artifacts.  I have no budget for this

	the one I ended up using was quicker to use than a plain drawing

	<p>I also kept looking at the new Xerces and Xalan.  All the unit tests
	are passing, but <code>PublishedDiffToHTML</code> prints nothing when
	I pass it a validation list.  I must figure out if this is due to the
	new Xalan or the test data.  I tried a couple of code samples, but they
	are still too large for me to track exactly what is going on.</p>

	<p>I upgraded the libraries anyway, I will figure out the kinks

	on Win98 and to authenticate properly, so I just dropped it.</p>

	<p>Only the Ant tasks left.  I've had some ideas about extracting
	the cut & pasted code in the tools and put it in central tool classes.
	The Ant tasks would just be another way to invoke those tool classes.
	So far, they would be in a new
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder</code> package.</p>

	<p>Fixed <code>MetricsTableModel</code>.
	<code>DependencyFinder</code> uses it to render dependency

	it miss the last row of data.  I also renamed
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependency.MetricsGatherer.ChartSize()</code>

	<p>Normalized naming of human-readable text printers from

	<p>Figured out how to get Ant's <code>&lt;cvsTagDiff&gt;</code>
	task work from "now" instead of "last midnight".  It turns out
	that adding the time to the date screws up how Ant generates
	the resulting CVS command.  There is an open bug report with
	Apache, so maybe they'll fix it in the future.  While we are
	waiting, I had to add the quotes in the tag's attribute myself.</p>

	<p>I'm thinking of getting rid of the <code>-plain</code> switch
	to some of the CLI tools.  It is useless.  I should be able to
	get rid of <code>com.jeantessier.dependency.TextPrinter</code>

	<p>Got rid of the <code>-trace</code> command-line switch.  If
	you want that level of details, edit <code>log4j.properties</code>.</p>

	<p>Reworked the <code>-verbose</code> command-line switch.  It
	prints progress as files are read and data is created, kind of like
	the status bar in the Swing applications.  The tools use the new
	<code>VerboseListener</code> to trap events and print them to the
	specified output stream or file.  This has helped simplify the
	code around <code>main()</code> in the tool classes.</p>

	<p>Considered optimizing event sources so they don't do anything
	if there are no registered listeners.  With the new mechanism
	for <code>-verbose</code>, there is always at least one listener,
	this optimization is therefore useless, so I dropped it.  For it
	to make sense, I would have had to complexify the life cycle of
	<code>VerboseListener</code> too much.</p>

	<p>SourceForge broke the locks on the CVS repository and I was

    <dd>
	<p>Used <code>onMouseOver</code> and <code>onMouseOut</code>
	JavaScript event handlers in the JSPs instead of <code>onFocus</code>
	and <code>onBlur</code> respectively.  This way, the hints appear
	in the status area as the mouse goes over each field and the
	user does not have to click into them, or use <code>TAB</code>
	to move between them and see the hints.</p>

	<p>Fixed the tables in the JSP so they show up correctly in
	either Mozilla or IE.  Lucky I recently learned about
	<code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code>
	tags.</p>

	<p>Someone locked the CVS repository for the project.  I tried
	to contact them through SourceForge, but the email bounced.  I
	opened a trouble ticket with SourceForge in the hope they can blast
	the lock themselves.</p>

	<p>Added tasks in <code>build.xml</code> to convert the text files
	that make up the documentation to HTML.  I also added by conversion
	perl script, <code>bin/txt2html.pl</code>.  It is finally under
	source control.  I had to adjust the <code>dist</code> target so it
	does not include it in the distribution.</p>

	<p>I realized that someone made a feature request on the SourceForge
	project page.  This is the first time in over a year that Dependency
	Finder has been open to the public.  The request is for Ant task
	equivalents to the CLI tools.  This should be easy enough.  All the
	XSL transforms can already be done with Ant's <code>&lt;xslt&gt;</code>
	core task.  For the other tools, you could use Ant's
	<code>&lt;java&gt;</code> task and pass in the equivalent parameters.
	But I think I will go one step further and actually create a new
	package with classes that extend
	<code>org.apache.tools.ant.Task</code>.  I will add sample usage in
	the Manual.  Thanks to Andy Laun for a great proposal.</p>

	<p>Changed initial status message in

	waiting time while <code>DirectoryExplorer</code> scans for
	<code>.class</code> files.</p>

	<p>I was having problems with <code>SumMeasurement</code>
	today.  I added trace statements to track down what was going
	on and it started going haywire.  Took me a while, but I
	realized its <code>Compute()</code> method was not thread-safe.
	I synchronized its processing and it is now fine.  I looked at
	the other measurements and <code>NbSubMetricsMeasurement</code>
	was in the same situation.  I fixed it too.</p>

	<p>I noticed that cut &amp; paste of values in
	<code>OOMetricsGUI</code> were coming through as calls to
	<code>toString()</code>, yielding the default stringification
	from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.  I added an implementation
	of <code>toString()</code> to <code>MeasurementBase</code> so
	that measurements print their numerical value by default.  It
	works well, except for <code>StatisticalMeasurement</code>
	which ends up displaying itself five times.</p>

	<p>Added standard deviation subvalue to

	<p>Fixed all the broken unit tests for metrics.</p>

	<p>Added metrics-processing events so the UI can track
	progress in <code>OOMetricsGUI</code>.</p>

	<p>For a while, Jakarta ORO had two versions of
	<code>Perl5Util.split()</code> that differed in how they
	split the empty string "".  They seem to have fixed the
	discrepancy in their latest version, so I moved my code
	to the new version that uses <code>java.util.Collection</code>
	instead of <code>java.util.Vector</code>, which is
	deprecated.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 27, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Finally got to fixing the broken unit tests, for metrics,
	at least.</p>

	<p>It turns out that JDK 1.4 is doing some funny accounting
	for line numbers in try ... catch blocks and this fixes some
	inaccuracies in my SLOC estimation.  These changes in the
	generated bytecode will help debuggers step through these
	clauses with more meaningful feedback.  By removing the
	special accounting in <code>MetricsGatherer</code>, the SLOC
	count of code compiled with previous versions of the JDK
	will be slightly underestimated.  But it is a rough estimate
	to begin with, so I guess it is safe.</p>

	<p>I am going to standardize the tests for JDK 1.4 and the
	way that it generates bytecode.  In the future, I might put
	special instrumentation in the tests to detect bytecode that
	has been compiled with previous versions of the JDK, but it
	is not a priority for now.</p>

    <dt>
	December 11, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>More refactoring for the <code>ClassfileLoader</code> event
	model.  I've added a concept of session, basically a call to
	<code>Load(Collection)</code>.  This will allow me to start
	measuring how long extraction is taking and maybe even make an
	estimate has to how much longer it'll take.  In the meantime,
	I have "percent completed" measurement in place.</p>

 	<p>I'm thinking of having one more release before the beta.
	This would let people out there use the latest features and
	bug fixes without having to wait for the user guide.  One
	thing that I would like to release quickly is the new, simpler
	user interface.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 10, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>Refactored <code>ClassfileLoader</code> and its subclasses.
	The decorators are now hidden inside the
	<code>ClassfileLoaderEventSource</code> class, so clients of the
	package don't have to bother with which decorator to instantiate.
	This paves the way to including progress measurements in the
	<code>LoadEvent</code> passed in <code>LoadStart()</code> and
	<code>LoadElement()</code> events.  This way, I can have either
	a "percent complete" or a progress bar as things are loading.
	I might even be able to have an elapsed time and a predicted
	remaining time.</p>

 	<p>Documented the methods of <code>LoadListener</code>, but I
	must revise the description of the various attributes and under
	which cases each one has a value.</p>

	from a previous presentation, but this would mean that I would have
	to come up with some new material if my submission to JavaOne is
	picked up.  Then again, I would have to come up with some new stuff

 	<p>Worked on tools documentation.</p>

 	<p>Found a bug with <code>GraphSummarizer</code>.  I describe it
	fully on SourceForge; it is bug 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=649375&group_id=43305&atid=435884">#649375</a>.
	Basically, when adding dependency between nodes from two different
	node factories, such as in <code>GraphSummarizer</code>, the logic
	that prevents self-dependencies relied on all classes of a package
	being present, which may not be the case while summarizing a graph.
	I rewrote the validation logic in <code>Node</code> and its subclasses
	to use a template method instead.  Since it does not rely on list
	traversal anymore, it should speed things up a bit (but I have not
	tried to measure it).</p>

	<p>Relabeled the beta from "0.1 beta" to "1.0 beta 1".  It might
	have a little more appeal, so more people will try the software.</p>

	using a Perl script to scan the <code>bin/</code> directory
	and automatically generate information about each script.
	When I am done, the template will use the same kind of
	annotation that I have been using for the user guide.
	This way, I can use the same translator for both files to
	convert them to HTML.  At first, I thought of generating
	XML and then use XSLT to convert it to HTML, but managing
	XML with embedded HTML tags proved too much.  This way,
	the notation is simpler and the embedded HTML does not get
	in the way.</p>

	Journal</a>.</p>

	<p>Found an article on dependencies titled <i>Managing Java
	Source Code Dependencies for SCM</i> in Java Developer Journal,
	vol. 7, no. 11, November 2002.  It deals mainly with compile-time
	dependencies and keeping track of components under revision
	control, but still makes a few good points regarding dependencies
	in general.</p>

	<p>Fixed some minor bugs in how I generate the manual.</p>

	<p>Discovered another free tool that deals with metrics:
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kclee.com/clemens/java/javancss/">JavaNCSS</a>.
	It includes two measurements: McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
	and its own non-comment source statement.  I really need to move
	<code>com.jeantessier.metrics</code> off of the Visitor pattern
	and let people code and add their own measurements.</p>

	<p>I looked up McCabe's cyclomatic complexity and it shouldn't
	be too hard to implement.  It's basically just a matter of counting
	specific instructions.</p>

	<p>Found another, older article by
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf">Robert C. Martin</a>
	about his "distance from the main sequence" dependency metric.</p>

 	<p>I worked out the design of a new <code>TransitiveClosure</code>
	that uses breadth-first search through the dependency graph.
	It is not based on <code>com.jeantessier.dependency.Visitor</code>
	and uses the Strategy pattern to decide how far to go from the
	scope, either up to a given path length or unbounded, with
	separate strategies for following inbound versus outbound
	dependencies.</p>

	<p>I also laid out the design for a <i>scope selector</i> to help
	with computing transitive closures on non-maximized graphs.  This
	will also come in handy for the next item today.</p>

	<p>I have also outlined the algorithm for finding the shortest
	paths between two groups of nodes, using the engine that computes
	transitive closures.  By growing closures from both groups, one
	following inbound dependencies and the other following outbound
	dependencies, and growing them until I have a non-empty
	intersection, I will get a subgraph that contains all the paths
	from A to B with minimal length.  I can use the <i>scope
	selector</i> described above to select source and sink groups.</p>

	<p>I also found out that <a href="http://sdmagazine.com/">Software
	Development</a> magazine is taking nominations for its Jolt Awards.
	I'm going to submit Dependency Finder.  But they don't want betas, so
	I will have to push up my release schedule.  I'll have a very
	short beta period and a release in December.  ;-)</p>

 	<p>I have been catching up on graph data structures and their
	operations by reading my old college textbooks again.  I was
	pleased to see that my implementation of dependency graphs was
	not too far from implementations they discuss in the book.  I
	was also pleased to see that <code>TransitiveClosure</code> uses
	a depth-first search algorithm, but the breadth-first search
	algorithm in the book is more in tune with what the class is
	trying to do.  I will write a breath-first class when I get a
	chance.</p>

	<p>The book also has an algorithm for finding a path between two
	<i>vertices</i> (nodes) in a graph.  I will modify it to find
	paths between two groups of vertices.</p>

 	<p>Got some new ideas on fixing the serialization of dependency
	graphs.  I can separate the nodes from the dependencies and put
	everything in a <code>Graph</code>-like object.  Each dependency
	would become its own object, allowing me to record additional
	information about each dependency such as its type (dependency,
	association, generalization, realization) and weight (how many
	times it occurs in the code).</p>

	trouble with the table that encloses controls.  The JSP
	works, it just doesn't look as great.  I'll worry about it
	later.</p>

 	<p>Added the same usage hints to controls as tool tips in
	the Swing version of <code>Dependency Finder</code> and

 	<p>Created a CSS stylesheet for this website.</p>

	<p>Further simplified the default settings in
	<code>DependencyFinder</code> and <code>query.jsp</code>.
	The new defaults print the entire package-to-package
	dependency graph, as opposed to the entire graph like
	it was doing before.  This is so that new users, as they
	start using the interface, can simply launch a query and
	see something useful without using all the memory available
	to render an immense graph.</p>

	<p>I will expand the manual to include a tutorial with
	sample queries and their results.</p>

	<p>There was a rendering problem for <code>JTable</code>
	under JDK 1.3.  I try to group rows in bands of three with
	alternating background colors.  For some reason, under JDK
	1.3, the cells in column 0 would not get the right background
	sometimes.  This problem is gone under JDK 1.4.  Since this
	is not breaking any functionality (it is just annoying), I
	will recommend that you upgrade your JVM if it bothers you.</p>

	<p>I'm dropping support for JDK 1.2.2.  I upgraded my
	JDK 1.3 from 1.3.1_01 to 1.3.1_05.  I also started playing
	with JDK 1.4.</p>

	<p>This is interesting, now.  JDK 1.4 ships with some basic
	XML support, including a version of Xerces.  But it looks
	like it's an older version than the one I'm using, because
	it requires me to explicitly specify the system property
	<code>org.xml.sax.driver</code>.  I need to dig further to
	figure out which version they're shipping and how I can
	force it to use the latest Xerces that I ship with
	Dependency Finder.  Maybe some day, in the far future, when
	I don't support JDK 1.3 anymore, I can stop shipping Xerces
	with Dependency Finder altogether.  But for now, I'm stuck.</p>

	<p>Maybe I can weasel out of it by requiring users to install
	JAXP 1.2 from Sun.  The documentation claims that JDK 1.4
	ships with JAXP 1.1.  Maybe JAXP 1.2 uses something close to
	the latest Xerces; and it also includes Xalan!  I will
	investigate further.</p>

	<p>Also, the compiler in JDK 1.4 behaves slightly differently
	from the one in JDK 1.3.  The result is that the unit tests
	are breaking because the compiled classes don't have the
	same number of features.  I will have to either revert back
	to JDK 1.3 or update the unit tests.  I haven't quite decided
	yet, but I'm leaning towards the latter.</p>

	<p>I also seems that JDK 1.4 has problems with Log4J too.
	More on this later.</p>

	<p>Upgraded the following development components:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Xerces</td>
	        <td>:</td>
		<td>2.1.0</td>
	        <td>-></td>
		<td>2.2.0</td>

	<p>I did a quick check to see if I can still compile
	Dependency Finder with JDK 1.2.2, but I can't anymore.
	I use <code>java.util.Collections.singletonList()</code> in
	<code>com.jeantessier.commandline.MultipleValuesSwitch</code>
	and a new constructor for
	<code>javax.swing.JRadioButtonMenuItem</code> in
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.gui.DependencyFinder</code>
	that takes an instance of
	<code>javax.swing.Action</code>.  Given the context in
	which these happen, I don't see how I can write around
	them in a clean way.</p>

	<p>So I'm probably just going to drop support of JDK
	1.2.2 and ask people to use Dependency Finder with
	JDK 1.3 and above.</p>

	<p>Everybody at work is asking how to use Dependency
	Finder.  I guess I need to work on usability and the
	intuitiveness of the user interface.</p>

	<p>Also, maybe the default settings should not try to
	print the whole dependency graph.  The two instances my
	colleague deployed have over 50,000 nodes and the JVM
	runs out of memory trying to render them.  A think a
	default of package-to-package dependencies might be
	better.</p>

	<p>Here, I need to choose between default settings that
	make it non-threatening to newbies versus settings that
	people use most of the time, so the tool is quick to use,
	without having to flip the same switches all the time.</p>

	They pointed out that I violate an XSLT rule when I reference
	validator instances in <code>match</code> clauses of
	<code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> tags.  It has been working
	until now because Xalan is lenient, but there is no guarantee
	that it will do so in the future or that the stylesheet will
	work with another XSLT translator.  I will need to rewrite

	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=615616&group_id=43305&atid=435884">bug #615616</a>.</p>

	<p>I used the Inherited Behavior design pattern to normalize
	the handling of attributes across implementations of the
	<code>com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor</code> interface.
	This solved the bug, but I had to change the DTD for
	classfiles.  I don't know how that will impact validity
	of outputs once I change it the web site that the tools
	point to by default.</p>

	<p>I worked out the problem with
	<code>PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl</code>.  If I use the full
	notation for Xalan extensions instead of the abbreviated
	one for Java, it works just fine, even with Xalan 2.4.0.
	So I will upgrade back to Xalan 2.4.0.  I opened a bug
	with the Xalan folks:

	I can't find anything in the documentation regarding
	changes on to specify extensions.  The release notes hint at
	improvements regarding detection of extensions, but there are
	no specifics.</p>

	<p>I have downgraded Xalan from 2.4.0 back to 2.3.1.</p>

	<p>I've had an idea for a new web app where people can

	Journal</a>.  The tool is called
	<a href="http://thesmallworlds.com/">Small Worlds</a> and it
	sells for around $1,750.  The screenshots are really nice.</p>

	<p>I need to write to JDJ, maybe get an article out of it.
	And I need to follow up on Martin Fowler and Bob Martin too.</p>

	<p>I put (most of) the website in CVS as a new module.</p>

	<p>I also had an idea for a possible layout of classes, by
	package, for a dependency graph.  Classes in a package are laid
	out in a circle, forming a cluster.  The clusters are they laid
	out in a larger circle.  This way, one can zoom in on a cluster
	to explore dependencies within a package.  If you zoom out far
	enough, inter-package dependencies dominate and packages with
	lots of dependencies stand out.</p>

	<p>Turns out <code>ListDiff</code> is not as easy to fix
	as I first expected.  I know I have to be smarter than
	just doing a prefix check in <code>ListDiffPrinter</code>,
	but how do I distinguish between a package name, a class
	name, and a field name?  The answer will drive how far the
	prefix match has to go.</p>

	<p>I have an idea.  I will have <code>ListDocumentedElements</code>
	mark each entry with a suffix in "<code> [P]</code>",
	"<code> [M]</code>", or "<code> [F]</code>".  Then, in
	<code>ListBasedValidator</code>, I will trim it off.  That
	will take care of <code>JarJarDiff</code> and the XSL
	transformations.  Then, in <code>ListDiffPrinter</code>,
	I can use this information to do better compression of the
	lists.</p>

	<p>I've opened a bug on the matter on the SourceForge
	project page.</p>

	<p>Someone found a problem with <code>ListDiff</code> and
	how it compresses lists.  It turns out that my simple use
	of prefixes when performing compression was a little too
	simplistic after all.  Packages mask subpackages.  Classes
	and fields with names that are prefix of others mask those
	others.  This should be easy enough to fix.</p>

	<p>Worked on the documentation a bit.  I tried to clarify how
	scoping and filtering work.</p>

	<p>I found out that <code>CodeDependencyCollector</code> treats
	dependencies coming from a class' static analyzer as if the
	dependencies emanated from the class itself.  This means that
	dependencies from the static initializer to features show up as
	class-to-feature dependencies, something I said in the manual
	did not exist.  Now I must decide if I'm going to amend the
	documentation or treat the static initializer like a feature.
	And if the latter, how am I going to name it?  I'm thinking
	maybe <code>package.Class.{}</code> or something similar.</p>

	<p>Worked on simplifying the UI in the web application.  Both
	<code>query.jsp</code> and <code>closure.jsp</code> now have
	a simple and an advanced form.  The advanced form has all the
	options whereas the simple form only takes regular expressions
	that apply to all packages, classes, and features.  I'm thinking

	<p><code>ListDiff</code> can now compress the resulting list.

	The same goes for packages and their classes.  Just call it
	with the <code>compress</code> switch.</p>

	<p>I changed the published list to use with

	<p>Addressed a possible performance issue which
	<code>com.jeantessier.metrics.XMLPrinter</code> where using

	I changed <code>OOMetrics</code> to use a tab character
	instead.  We'll see how it goes.  At the same time, I adjusted
	<code>XMLPrinter</code> to generate &lt;measurement&gt;
	nodes instead of &lt;metric&gt;.  It will also ignore
	<code>NullMeasurement</code> instances from here on.</p>

	<p>Use the system property <code>line.separator</code>
	instead of "\n" in metrics reports.  This should help with
	cross-platform portability.</p>

	<p>Rigged <code>MetricsFactory</code> to handle group
	definitions properly.</p>

	<p>I've been looking at using tool tips in the header of the
	result tables in <code>OOMetricsGUI</code> to expand the

	<p>The optional validation was not enough when working in a

	<p>I have figured out how to work around the expression size

	<p>I am now done with the higher-resolution validation feature.</p>

	<p>The XSL stylesheets for <code>JarJarDiff</code> seem to work

	<p>First shot at tracking documentation levels using
	<code>JarJarDiff</code>.</p>

	<p>After looking at the format used by Argo/UML to save UML project
	files, I'm having renewed interest in XMI to import dependency
	graph into UML modeling tools.  This would allow people to draw
	the graph visually using their favorite UML tool.  Argo/UML also
	uses PGML to store graphics.  This has led to W3C to standardize
	SVG, which I might be looking into in the future.</p>

	March 31, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>I finished the reorganization of the <code>Differences</code>
	hierarchy for the Decorator pattern.  I have made this change to
	ease listing of documentation status changes.  Come to think of
	it, I might not have needed this change to do the new feature.</p>

	<p>I have added some documentation for <code>JarJarDiff</code>
	in preparation for the new feature..</p>

    <dd>
	<p>I reorganized the <code>Differences</code> hierarchy to
	make room for a Decorator pattern.  I'm reimplementing tracking
	of deprecated features to arrange the code.  After that, I'll
	be better able to take care of documented vs. undocumented
	programming elements.</p>

	<p>Right now, I've broken something.  I don't have the adequate
	unit tests to tell me what it is that I broke.  I guess I've
	been a bad boy.  This will take a little while to fix.</p>

	<p>I am rediscovering the <code>com.jeantessier.diff</code>

	<p>That validation list is still giving me headaches.  How can I
	make that feature fit without breaking the <i>purity</i> of my

    <dd>
	<p>I have regained control over <code>DiffToExternalHTML</code>.</p>

	<p>With finer control over validation, how the validation list
	is generated and used becomes more and more important.  If we use
	javadoc comments, and we want to track when things transition
	from valid to invalid or vice versa, we now need a list for the
	old version and a list for the new version.  How these two lists
	are combined and used remains to be determined.  Should they be
	fed to <code>JarJarDiff</code> and merged into the XML output?
	Should they be fed to the XSL stylesheet, making it even more
	convoluted?  And what about <code>DiffToHTML.xsl</code>?  Should
	it start to use Java code too?</p>

	<p>I streamlined <code>Diff.dtd</code> to remove duplicated
	information in the output of <code>JarJarDiff</code>.</p>

	<p>I wrote <code>ListBasedValidator</code> and I have
	<code>ListVisibleElements</code>, a doclet for listing programming
	elements that have been flagged through their javadoc comments.
	This way, one can use javadoc tags to flag classes and features
	as part of the published API and guide <code>DiffToExternalHTML</code>
	to limit the report to those classes and features.</p>

	I added it to <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code> too.  I'm
	thinking of making that one simply an XML filter and use the new
	<code>DiffToHTML.xsl</code> for all rendering.  But I will need
	to figure out how to efficiently copy XML trees in XSLT.</p>

	<p>I need a release plan.  I've had a number of ideas lately for
	new features and I need to scope what's doable and what's not,
	and have some idea of when I can expect the release.</p>

	<p>I fixed <code>TransitiveClosure</code>.  I also added to it a
	feature where it can now follow inbound dependencies in addition
	to outbound ones.  Maybe this will become handy somehow.  I'm
	thinking of limiting the depth of the closure exploration, though.
	And finally, it now has two modes of operation: one where it only
	records the first dependency that led to a <code>Node</code>, and
	another where it records all such paths.</p>

	<p>I adjusted the code so that Log4J is initialized from
	<code>log4.properties</code> located on the <code>CLASSPATH</code>.
	I thought about putting the file in <code>DependencyFinder.jar</code>,
	but decided against.  If someone is familiar with Log4J, they can
	edit the configuration file and adjust logging to their liking.
	It took a lot of hard work to figure it out.  I had to follow all
	the steps below, pretty much in that order:</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>RTFM</li>
	    <li>RTFM</li>
	    <li>RTFM :-)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I temporarily removed <code>xerces.jar</code> and <code>xalan.jar</code>
	from the web application WAR file.  This dramatically reduced its size.
	I also added <code>deploy</code> and <code>undeploy</code> targets to
	the <code>build.xml</code> file for Tomcat.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 03, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>I adjusted <code>GraphCopier</code> and <code>GraphSummarizer</code>
	to reduce the noise in their scope output.  They used to output the
	whole package of any node that was in scope.  This often produced extra
	output that would obscure the answer to the query.</p>

	<p>The new <code>GraphCopier</code> maintains a separate <code>NodeFactory</code>
	for scoped nodes and filtered nodes.  Only nodes in the scope are
	created using the scoping <code>NodeFactory</code>.  This cuts away
	a lot of extraneous information.</p>

	<p>This has unfortunately broken <code>TransitiveClosure</code>.</p>

	<p>I put the functionality for exploring dependency graphs

	<dl>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>name</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		A user-friendly name for the codebase.  This allows
		users to know the subject of the dependency graph
		without revealing where it is on the server's file
		system.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>source</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		The compiled Java code to be extracted.  You can
		specify multiple locations by separating them with
		commas.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>mode</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		Whether to maximize or minimize the graph, or leave
		it in raw form.
	    </dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The application consists of only two JSPs:</p>

	<dl>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>extract.jsp</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		Extracts the dependency graph from the source specified
		by <code>application.getInitParameter("source")</code>.
		The graph will further be processed based on
		<code>application.getInitParameter("mode")</code>.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>query.jsp</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		Displays a subset of the dependency graph, according
		to the user-specified scope and filter.

	<p>I've been considering switching from Log4J to the
	JDK 1.4 Logging API. I decided against it after reading
	<a target="_black" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html">
	Ceki G&uuml;lc&uuml;'s comparison of the two</a>.  I've
	played a little bit with the Logging API and it was very
	difficult to introduce a new format for the logged messages.
	I believe Log4J is more flexible and easier to use.</p>

	<p>This being said, I still need to work out the
	<code>-verbose</code> and <code>-trace</code> switches so
	that they properly adjust the logging configuration.</p>

	<p>I also need to compare the speed of the tools when
	they use Log4J as opposed to <code>com.jeantessier.log</code>.</p>

	<p>I got rid of the <code>JAVA_BIN</code> and
	<code>JAVA_EXE</code> environment variables.  I should be

	<p><code>OOMetricsGUI</code> is a Swing GUI put on top of

	<p>I fixed a problem with inner classes.  <code>OOMetrics</code> was
	counting all inner class entries in the InnerClasses class attribute.
	This included references to inner classes in other classes, resulting
	in a count that was higher than reality.  It now restricts itself to
	actual inner classes of the current class, resulting in the correct
	count.</p>

	<p>I also adjusted how the <code>jt.classreader.Classfile</code>
	constructor writes trace entries about its constant pool.  This way,
	the text of the pool gets generated only if there is a log object to
	print it.  I'm expecting a 25% improvement in performance as this
	involves quite a bit of conversions when printing the entries in the
	constant pool.</p>

	<p>I also fixed a bug in <code>OOMetrics</code> so that it now uses the

	<p>For a while now, I have been less than pleased at having to

	explores the graph more fully to compensate for the sparseness of the
	graph.  This modification will shorten the time it takes to read the graph,
	but queries will take longer to process.  Usage in the field will tell which
	mode works best on real projects, whether it is <i>normal</i>, <i>minimized</i>,

	<p>I might have to have two sets of parsed classes, one for

	to correctly compute the Depth of Inheritance metric.</p>

	<p>I need to modify <code>jt.metrics.ui.OOMetrics</code> so that

	be visible if it was declared <code>public</code> or
	<code>protected</code>.  The XML node gets a new attribute to
	indicate that a removed feature is now inherited.  The XSL
	stylesheet can then choose to ignore the removed feature, if it
	wants to.</p>

	<p>I've added a tool called <code>DiffToInheritanceChange</code>
	that lists interfaces and classes whose <code>extends</code>
	or <code>implements</code> clause have changed.</p>

	<p>I fixed a bug in the package <code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>

	file, such as those generated by the Microsoft compiler.</p>

	<p>I also fixed bugs in <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code> dealing

	<p><code>JarJarDiff</code> is done, along with its stylesheets.  If I
	have the time, I'll build test cases so we can verify that it really
	does trap everything it's supposed to.</p>

	<p>The script <code>JarJarDiff.bat</code> takes two codebases (JAR files,
	Zip files, or directories) and saves the differences in an XML document.</p>

	<p>The script <code>DiffToInternalHTML.bat</code> takes the XML document
	generated by <code>JarJarDiff</code> and transforms it completely to HTML.</p>

	<p>The script <code>DiffToExternalHTML.bat</code> takes the XML document
	generated by <code>JarJarDiff</code> and transforms the public subset of
	it to HTML.</p>

	<p>I may need to split this website according to the various tools:</p>

	<p>Pretty much done.</p>

	<p>In <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code>, I now use an XSLT Extension
	in Xalan-Java to limit the report to a subset of packages defined in a
	separate file.  The XSL stylesheet has a default value for the filename,
	and I should be able to pass in a value from the command-line.  I can
	now trap changes in <code>extends</code>, <code>implements</code>, and
	<code>throws</code> clauses, as well as in the return type of methods.</p>

	<p>In <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code>, I need to filter out

	<p>Refactored <code>JarJarDiff</code> and the XSL stylesheets
	to generate both reports from the same XML file.  <code>JarJarDiff</code>
	still supports the <code>-external</code> switch, but not for
	long.  I am also more strict regarding what goes in the external
	(i.e., public) report.  Now, all I need to do is be still more
	strict on what features are reported, and restrict the report to
	a subset of packages.</p>

	<p>It turns out we want feature signatures after all.</p>

	March 14, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Refactored <code>JarJarDiff</code> and the

	XSL stylesheet accordingly.  Now, all I need to do is be more
	strict on what features are reported, and restrict the report
	to a subset of packages.</p>

	<p>Also, do we want feature signatures or full declarations in

    <dd>
	<p>Renamed the <code>JarDiff</code> tool to <code>JarJarDiff</code>,
	at a friend's recommendation.  I adjusted the output so that it
	lists methods by signature instead of name.  It actually outputs
	XML and has a XSL stylesheet for converting to HTML.  I don't have
	one for text, yet.</p>

	<p>I've added a tool to compute the transitive closure of elements.
	It is named <code>DependencyClosure</code>.  If creates a sub-graph
	of the dependency graph by following outbound dependencies.  By
	starting on one class, you can find out all the classes that are
	used directly or indirectly by that class.  It uses the same scoping
	and filtering engine as <code>DependencyReporter</code>.</p>

	<p>I've added another tool to compute dependency statistics, such
	as the number of inbound vs. outbound links.  It is named
	<code>DependencyMetrics</code>.  I also renamed <code>Metrics</code>
	to <code>ClassMetrics</code> in the process.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 08, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Added the <code>JarDiff</code> tool to compare different
	versions of the same codebase, using the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package.  This first version is pretty stupid and writes
	only text output from <code>main()</code>.  It needs to
	be refactored to produce XML, and then use XSL stylesheets
	to generate text and HTML reports.</p>

	<p>I've added many utility methods in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package to help in interrogating classes.</p>

    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Fixed the <code>.bat</code> files.  Also created the
	<code>readme.txt</code> file that explains how to install
	the tool.  The <code>.bat</code> files still depend on the
	<code>JAVA_EXE</code> environment variable.  I need to fix
	that so that the <code>.bat</code> files try <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
	and/or give a nice error message when they cannot find the JVM.</p>

	<p>Added <code>Metrics</code> to handle class metrics gathering,
	as described on March 5.  I have yet to gather metrics about
	dependencies.</p>

	<p>Fixed some bugs with parsing <code>.class</code> files.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 05, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>I tweaked <code>CodeDependencyCollector</code> to process
	<code>new</code>, <code>anewarray</code>, <code>checkcast</code>,
	<code>instanceof</code>, and <code>multianewarray</code> opcodes.
	It doesn't seem to add any dependencies that were not already
	found by just looking at field access and method call instructions,
	but maybe this is just a quirk of my code.</p>

	<p>I need to adjust the <code>.bat</code> files so that they
	are no longer tied to my environment.  I'll create a
	<code>DEPENDENCYFINDER_HOME</code> environment variable,
	this way people only need to set that variable to start
	using the tools.  Eventually, I could look at some kind of
	InstallShield or InstallAnywhere solution.</p>

	<p>I also want to create some additional implementations of the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader.Visitor</code>
	interface to compute software metrics, such as:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>number of packages, classes, methods</li>
	    <li>number of classes per package or methods per class</li>
	    <li>number of public, static, or synthetic classes or features (i.e., fields and methods)</li>
	    <li>...</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I could do the same with additional implementations of the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.model.Visitor</code>
	interface to compute software metrics, such as:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>number of outbound dependencies per package, class, or feature</li>
	    <li>number of inbound dependencies per package, class, or feature</li>
	    <li>...</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For these last dependency metrics, the tools should be applicable to
	the output of both <code>DependencyExtractor</code> and
	<code>DependencyReporter</code>, so that scoping can be used without
	duplicating the functionality in <code>DependencyReporter</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 02, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>After running the tools on themselves, I reorganized
	the package hierarchy and simplified it greatly.</p>

        <p>I added XSL stylesheets for converting dependency graphs
	to text and HTML.  Each stylesheet has three version:</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>Whole graph</li>
	    <li>List only outbound dependencies (show nodes that are dependent on others)</li>
	    <li>List only inbound dependencies (show dependable nodes, i.e., depended upon)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I added shorthand options to <code>DependencyReporter</code>.
	I also added shorthand <code>.bat</code> files.</p>

	<p>I adjusted <code>DependencyExtractor</code> to scan the
	bytecode using <code>CodeDependencyCollector</code> instead
	of limiting itself to traversing the constant pool and looking
	at signatures.</p>

	<p>I refactored <code>Collector</code>, making it an interface
	with a base implementation (<code>CollectorBase</code>) and
	creating an inheritance ladder with <code>Visitor</code>.</p>

	<p>I found yet another bug with <code>byte</code> as a signed type.
	There may be others still waiting to manifest themselves.</p>

     <dt>
	March 01, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added a script for doing XSL Transformations.  It uses
	Apache's Xalan.  Now all I need are some XSL stylesheets.</p>

	<p><code>DependencyReporter</code> is working fine, except
	that the command-line is starting to exceed DOS limits.
	I will need to create an XML configuration document if
	I want to process complex queries.</p>

	<p>I fixed <code>DependencyExtractor</code> so that it can
	read from JAR and Zip files.</p>

	<p>I found yet another bug caused by things use index 0 in
	the constant pool to represent special cases.  There may be
	others still waiting to manifest themselves.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>Simplified the command-line interfaces to the major
	tools (<code>DependencyExtractor</code> and
	<code>DependencyReporter</code>).</p>

	<p>Fixed <code>Reporter</code> to assume it is operating
	on a maximized graph.  This simplifies the processing and
	minimizes traversals.  This might have also solved the
	printing problems I was experiencing.</p>

	<p>Fixed a bug where a feature could get a dependency
	on its class or package, and vice versa.  The same
	thing was happening between classes and packages.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 27, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added the <code>CodeIterator</code> class in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package.  This allows me to traverse bytecode and capture
	dependencies originating from methods.  I have yet to figure
	out exactly how to use it.  I'm thinking of writing a
	new <code>DependencyCollector</code> to do all the
	collecting, instead of the current two step class then
	feature collection.</p>

	<p>Added the <code>Reporter</code> class in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.model.Visitor</code>
	hierarchy.  This allows me to build a <code>Node</code>
	graph from the dependency graph which answers queries
	such as package-to-package dependencies and the like.
	I've adjusted <code>DependencyReporter</code> to make
	use of this new class.  There are still problems with
	displaying scopes of other things than packages, but it
	should be easy to solve.</p>

	<p>The interfaces to <code>DependencyExtractor</code> and
	<code>DependencyReporter</code> need work to make them
	easier to use.</p>

	<p>I must fix the deserialization bug in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader.Classfile</code>
	package.</p>

	<p>I must also make the whole
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader.Classfile</code>
	easier to use for general purposes (i.e., Jeff).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 21, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added the <code>ClassfileLoader</code> hierarchy in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package.  This allows me to read from <code>.class</code>
	files from a directory tree, from a JAR file, or from a
	Zip files.</p>

	<p>Right now, the loaders load and parse everything in
	the constructors.  I need to enhance these classes to
	do lazy loading and provide a list of the entries they
	contain.  Whether these entries will be file names or
	class names is not decided yet.</p>

	<p>I also need to enhance the classes in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package to provide better navigation and query mechanisms
	in the <code>Classfile</code>-rooted structure.  I need to
	be able to pull methods and fields by name rather than
	iterate through the collections.  I need to simple query
	methods when looking for tagging attributes such as
	<code>Synthetic_attribute</code> or <code>Deprecated_attribute</code>.</p>

    <dt>
	February 20, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added a SAX parser for reading the dependency
	<a href="Components.html#xml">XML format</a>, using Xerces
	from Apache.</p>

	<p>Added an embryonic <code>DependencyReporter</code> tool.
	I'm thinking of having this tools output some form of XML
	and then use XSLT to convert it to whatever I need.  I
	would most likely use Apache's Xalan for that.</p>

	<p>I'm also thinking of another tool that would create
	a file hierarchy that mirrors the one from <code>javadoc</code>.
	This way, I could embed dependency information in the
	automatically generated documentation.  Each class comments
	could include a hyperlink to a local file with the dependencies
	for that class.  The same would go for packages.</p>

	<p>I also need to figure a way to read <code>.class</code>
	from JAR files, in addition to directories.</p>

    <dt>
	February 16, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Renamed the extraction tool from
	<code>DependencyFinder</code> to
	<code>DependencyExtractor</code>.</p>

	<p>Added <code>LinkMinimizer</code> and
	<code>LinkMaximizer</code> visitors to control the
	size of the dependency graph.  <code>LinkMinimizer</code>
	removes redundant edges while <code>LinkMaximizer</code>
	replicates edges.  The minimal graphs gives a more compact
	representation, but traversal can be slowed down.  The
	full graph takes up more space, but its traversal will
	be more efficient when computing metrics such as
	aggregated package dependencies.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>Refactored the

        <p>Added <code>DirectoryExplorer</code> and the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.model</code>
	package.  The new <code>DependencyFinder</code>
	tool either prints the <i>forest of packages</i>
	or the burgeoning <a href="Components.html#xml">XML output</a>.</p>

        <p>We may have a problem with inlined code.  Features

        <p>Regarding the need for compiling in debug mode
	(<code>-g</code> switch).  This is required in order to
	capture dependencies created by the type of local variables
	in methods.  The compiler verifies the legality of type
	assignments and then discards the type information.  When
	the compiler is called with <code>-g</code>, it keeps the
	type information to create the <code>LocalVariableTable</code>
	attribute of <code>Code</code> attributes.  If the
	assignment is legal, then it meets all the dependency
	requirements.  It either uses the same dependency, or creates
	a new one which is more restrictive than the initial
	dependency (i.e., it transitively includes the former).
	Dependencies are not automatically considered transitive,
	but in this case they are.  It is therefore acceptable
	to ignore the dropped dependency.  If someone really
	wants to see it, he or she simply has to compile the
	code using <code>-g</code> and run the dependency
	finder again.</p>

        <p>I should consider turning this into an Ant task.</p>

        <p>What if I used a <code>ClassLoader</code> instead to
	trap class requests as the target class is being
	resolved?  The good thing about looking at the
	<code>.class</code> file only is that I don't need to
	have all the dependencies on the <code>CLASSPATH</code>
	at the time.</p>

	<p>I looked at the classes used by <code>javac</code>
	and it appears to be a mess.  I'll stick with my things
	for now.</p>

        <p>I reinstated the Visitor pattern in the
	<code>jt.dependencygenerator.classreader</code>
	package with a vengeance.  It turned out to
	be useful in other areas of the <code>.class</code>
	file as well.  Visitors can now explore the
	whole <code>.class</code> file, including fields,
	methods, and attributes.</p>

	<p>I moved the <code>ClassReader</code> tool from the
	<code>jt.dependencygenerator.classreader</code>
	package to the <code>jt.dependencygenerator.tools</code>
	package.</p>

	<p>The extractor now reads the entire <code>.class</code>
	file.</p>

	<p>It has problems reading from compressed JAR files.
	It seems to be OK with uncompressed ones.  Maybe I can
	use the <code>java.util.jar</code> package to read the
	whole byte stream in memory before starting the processing.</p>

	<p>Handed a copy of the code to Jeff Chan.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>I broke out the package and got rid of the Visitor
	pattern in the
	<code>jt.dependencygenerator.classreader</code>
	package because I had only one simple visitable
	object.</p>

	<p>The extractor only reads from the constant pool,
	which only holds references to methods that are
	called and fields that are accessed.  Each field
	and method entry later in the <code>.class</code>
	file maintains its own index to the name and
	descriptor (i.e., signature) in the constant pool.</p>

	<p>I must parse deeper in the <code>.class</code>
	file to extract field and method entries and
	get the references I need from there.</p>

	<p>I must also make sure that I capture dependences
	from local variables in methods!</p>

	<p>Fran&ccedil;ois is looking for a JAR
	comparison tool to analyze differences between two
	versions of a given JAR file.  Once I've tuned the
	<code>.class</code> file parser, we could use it to
	extract API information from JAR files.</p>
