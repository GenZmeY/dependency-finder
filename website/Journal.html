	<p>Updated the example for <code>LinkMinimizer</code> and
	<code>LinkMaximizer</code> and merged it with the User Manual.</p>

	<p>I also had a idea to use a <code>Writer</code> in the various
	<code>Printer</code> classes.  This would ease the resource needs
	of various command-line operations since the tools would not need
	to hold all the output in memory.  Anyway, I'm just thinking about
	it at this time.</p>

	<p>Added an <a href="AvsI.html">analysis</a> study of Robert
	Martin's metrics, as described in Robert C. Martin's
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.PDF">Design Principles and Design Patterns</a> article.</p>

	<p>Also added <a href="CVSDiff/">output</a> from

	<p>Played with SourceForge resources.  Someone mentioned that I
	might be able to use SourceForge shell server to test Unix lauch
	scripts.  The shell server does not have compilers and connecting
	through SSH is tedious, so I will not do this on an extended basis.
	But I did setup the website as a checkout from CVS.  Now I need to
	figure out how to setup the cron job so it updates itself
	automatically.</p>

	<p>I think I've got it...</p>

	<p>Changed initial status message in
	<code>MetricsExtractAction</code> and
	<code>DependencyExtractAction</code> to account for long
	waiting time while <code>DirectoryExplorer</code> scans for
	<code>.class</code> files.</p>

	<p>I was having problems with <code>SumMeasurement</code>
	today.  I added trace statements to track down what was going
	on and it started going haywire.  Took me a while, but I
	realized its <code>Compute()</code> method was not thread-safe.
	I synchronized its processing and it is now fine.  I looked at
	the other measurements and <code>NbSubMetricsMeasurement</code>
	was in the same situation.  I fixed it too.</p>

	<p>I noticed that cut &amp; paste of values in
	<code>OOMetricsGUI</code> were coming through as calls to
	<code>toString()</code>, yielding the default stringification
	from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.  I added an implementation
	of <code>toString()</code> to <code>MeasurementBase</code> so
	that measurements pring their numerical value by default.  It
	works well, except for <code>StatisticalMeasurement</code>
	which ends up displaying itself five times.</p>

	<p>Added standard deviation subvalue to
	<code>StatisticalMeasurement</code>.</p>

	<p>Added an <code>InRange()</code> method to <code>Metrics</code>
	that returns <code>false</code> if any of the measurements is not
	in range.</p>

	January 18, 2003
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Looked at ways to restrict listed metrics to the classes and
	methods actually visited, instead of all referenced elements.  I
	tried to distinguish between getting a metrics and creating it
	only as part of a <code>VisitX()</code> method, but that didn't
	work since metrics would only start accumulating after their
	call to <code>VisitX()</code>.  I'll have to try something else.</p>

	recognizing static initilizers of the form "<code>static {}</code>".</p>

	<p>Switched <code>log4j.properties</code> to use CHAINSAW instead
	of log files.</code>

	<p>Found another article on <a href="http://thesmallworlds.com/">Small Worlds</a>.
	This time, it was a review in Software Development Magazine.</p>

	<p>The more I think of it, the more I was to revamp
	<code>-verbose</code> and get rid of <code>-trace</code>
	switches.  I'll have <code>-verbose</code> behave somewhat like
	<code>extract.jsp</code> or the status bar of the GUI tools.</p>

	<p>I now have progress bars on the GUIs!</p>

 	<p>I am going to do one more release release before the beta,
	either tomorrow (12/31) or the day after (1/1).  Like I said
	before, this will let people out there use the new features
	and bug fixes without having to wait on the user guide.</p>
    </dd>
   <dt>
	December 28, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Fixed all the broken unit tests for metrics.</p>

	<p>Added metrics-processing events so the UI can track
	progress in <code>OOMetricsGUI</code>.</p>

	<p>For a while, Jakarta ORO had two versions of
	<code>Perl5Util.split()</code> that differed in how they
	split the empty string "".  They seem to have fixed the
	discrepency in their latest version, so I moved my code
	to the new version that uses <code>java.util.Collection</code>
	instead of <code>java.util.Vector</code>, which is
	deprecated.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 27, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Finally got to fixing the broken unit tests, for metrics,
	at least.</p>

	<p>It turns out that JDK 1.4 is doing some funny accounting
	for line numbers in try ... catch blocks and this fixes some
	inaccuracies in my SLOC estimation.  These changes in the
	generated bytecode will help debuggers step through these
	clauses with more meaningful feedback.  By removing the
	special accounting in <code>MetricsGatherer</code>, the SLOC
	count of code compiled with previous versions of the JDK
	will be slightly underestimated.  But it is a rough estimate
	to begin with, so I guess it is safe.</p>

	<p>I am going to standardize the tests for JDK 1.4 and the
	way that it generates bytecode.  In the future, I might put
	special instrumentation in the tests to detect bytecode that
	has been compiled with previous versions of the JDK, but it
	is not a priority for now.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 26, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Finally got around to checking that the upgrade to Xalan
	did fix
	<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13106">bug 13106</a>.
	It works, but I must still rewrite the stylesheet to comply
	with XSLT rules.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 21, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>Refactored
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.gui.DependencyFinder</code>.</p>

 	<p>Also refactored some of the metrics handling code to simplify
	processing of multiple measurements.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 19, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>I have been thinking some more about the progress status and
	what information would be displayed in a dialog, such as elapsed
	time and a guesstimate of how much more time will be required.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 11, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>More refactoring for the <code>ClassfileLoader</code> event
	model.  I've added a concept of session, basically a call to
	<code>Load(Collection)</code>.  This will allow me to start
	measuring how long extraction is taking and maybe even make an
	estimate has to how much longer it'll take.  In the meantime,
	I have "percent completed" measurement in place.</p>

 	<p>I'm thinking of having one more release before the beta.
	This would let people out there use the latest features and
	bug fixes without having to wait for the user guide.  One
	thing that I would like to release quickly is the new, simpler
	user interface.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 10, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>Refactored <code>ClassfileLoader</code> and its subclasses.
	The decorators are now hidden inside the
	<code>ClassfileLoaderEventSource</code> class, so clients of the
	package don't have to bother with which decorator to instantiate.
	This paves the way to including progress measurements in the
	<code>LoadEvent</code> passed in <code>LoadStart()</code> and
	<code>LoadElement()</code> events.  This way, I can have either
	a "percent complete" or a progress bar as things are loading.
	I might even be able to have an elapsed time and a predicted
	remaining time.</p>

 	<p>Documented the methods of <code>LoadListener</code>, but I
	must revise the description of the various attributes and under
	which cases each one has a value.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 06, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>Refactored <code>CanAddDependency()</code>.</p>

 	<p>Fixed references in slides for the tutorial.  I need to think
	about this before I publish it on the website.  I used the slides
	from a previous presentation, but this would mean that I would have
	to come up with some new material if my submission to JavaOne is
	picked up.  Then again, I would have to come up with some new stuff
	anyway!</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 05, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>Worked on tools documentation.</p>

 	<p>Found a bug with <code>GraphSummarizer</code>.  I describe it
	fully on SourceForge; it is bug 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=649375&group_id=43305&atid=435884">#649375</a>.
	Basically, when adding dependency between nodes from two different
	node factories, such as in <code>GraphSummarizer</code>, the logic
	that prevents self-dependencies relied on all classes of a package
	being present, which may not be the case while summarizing a graph.
	I rewrote the validation logic in <code>Node</code> and its subclasses
	to use a template method instead.  Since it does not rely on list
	traversal anymore, it should speed things up a bit (but I have not
	tried to measure it).</p>

	<p>Relabeled the beta from "0.1 beta" to "1.0 beta 1".  It might
	have a little more appeal, so more people will try the software.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 04, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>Worked on tools documentation.  Got rid of original
	<code>Tools.xml</code>, copied the information so far into
	<code>Tools.txt</code>.  Pretty soon, I will have to put
	the Perl script generator under source control too.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	December 03, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Checked in a bunch of changes that were just accumulating
	on my machine.</p>

	<p>Upgraded the following development components:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Xerces</td>
	        <td>:</td>
		<td>2.2.0</td>
	        <td>-></td>
		<td>2.2.1</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Xalan</td>
	        <td>:</td>
		<td>2.4.0</td>
	        <td>-></td>
		<td>2.4.1</td>
	    </tr>
	</table>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The upgrade to Xalan should have fixed
	<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13106">bug 13106</a>.
	I'll check it out tomorrow.</p>

    <dd>
 	<p>Finished the generator and generated a template for
	documenting the tools that make up Dependency Finder.
	Now, I must fill in the template.</p>

	<p>I'm afraid that I must forget about the Jolt Awards
	this year.  No way I can get an official major release
	out before December 31.  But next year, for sure.</p>
    </dd>
     <dt>
	November 25, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
 	<p>Started working on a generator for a template for
	documenting the tools that make	up Dependency Finder.  I am
	using a Perl script to scan the <code>bin/</code> directory
	and automatically generate information about each script.
	When I am done, the template will use the same kind of
	annotation that I have been using for the user guide.
	This way, I can use the same translator for both files to
	convert them to HTML.  At first, I thought of generating
	XML and then use XSLT to convert it to HTML, but managing
	XML with embedded HTML tags proved too much.  This way,
	the notation is simpler and the embedded HTML does not get
	in the way.</p>

 	<p>Submitted a proposal for the <i>Spotlight on Open Source</i>
	column in <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/java/">Java Developer
	Journal</a>.</p>

	<p>Found an article on dependencies titled <i>Managing Java
	Source Code Dependencies for SCM</i> in Java Developer Journal,
	vol. 7, no. 11, November 2002.  It deals mainly with compile-time
	dependencies and keeping track of components under revision
	control, but still makes a few good points regarding dependencies
	in general.</p>

 	<p>Technical documentation.</p>

	<p>Discovered another free tool that deals with metrics:
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kclee.com/clemens/java/javancss/">JavaNCSS</a>.
	It includes two measurements: McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
	and its own non-comment source statement.  I really need to move
	<code>com.jeantessier.metrics</code> off of the Visitor pattern
	and let people code and add their own measurements.</p>

	<p>I looked up McCabe's cyclomatic complexity and it shouldn't
	be too hard to implement.  It's basically just a matter of counting
	specific instructions.</p>

	<p>Found another, older article by
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf">Robert C. Martin</a>
	about his "distance from the main sequence" dependency metric.</p>

    <dd>
 	<p>I worked out the design of a new <code>TransitiveClosure</code>
	that uses breadth-first search through the dependency graph.
	It is not based on <code>com.jeantessier.dependency.Visitor</code>
	and uses the Strategy pattern to decide how far to go from the
	the scope, either up to a given path length or unbounded, with
	separate strategies for following inbound versus outbound
	dependencies.</p>

	<p>I also laid out the design for a <i>scope selector</i> to help
	with computing transitive closures on non-maximized graphs.  This
	will also come in handy for the next item today.</p>

	<p>I have also outlined the algorithm for finding the shortest
	paths between two groups of nodes, using the engine that computes
	transitive closures.  By growing closures from both groups, one
	following inbound dependencies and the other following outbound
	dependencies, and growing them until I have a non-empty
	intersection, I will get a subgraph that contains all the paths
	from A to B with minimal length.  I can use the <i>scope
	selector</i> described above to select source and sink groups.</p>

	<p>I also found out that <a href="http://sdmagazine.com/">Software
	Development Magazine</a> is taking nominations for its Jolt Awards.
	I'm gonna submit Dependency Finder.  But they don't want betas, so
	I will have to push up my release schedule.  I'll have a very
	short beta period and a release in december.  ;-)</p>

    <dd>
 	<p>I have been catching up on graph data structures and their
	operations by reading my old college textbooks again.  I was
	pleased to see that my implementation of dependency graphs was
	not too far from implementations they discuss in the book.  I
	was also pleased to see that <code>TransitiveClosure</code> uses
	a depth-first search algorithm, but the breadth-first search
	algorithm in the book is more in tune with what the class is
	trying to do.  I will write a breath-first class when I get a
	chance.</p>

	<p>The book also has an algorithm for finding a path between two
	<i>vertices</i> (nodes) in a graph.  I will modify it to find
	paths betweeen two groupes of vertices.</p>

 	<p>Wrote a new unit test for <code>TransitiveClosure</code>.
	Right now, it requires a maximized graph to be useful.  I want
	to have it accept any graph, like I did for <code>GraphCopier</code>
	with <code>GraphSummarizer</code>.</p>

 	<p>Got some new ideas on fixing the serialization of dependency
	graphs.  I can separate the nodes from the dependencies and put
	everything in a <code>Graph</code>-like object.  Each dependency
	would become its own object, allowing me to record additional
	information about each dependency such as its type (dependency,
	association, generalization, realization) and weight (how many
	times it occurs in the code).</p>

	<p>Looked at possible graphical renders for metrics.</p>

 	<p>Added the same usage hints to controls as tool tips in

 	<p>Created a CSS stylesheet for this website.</p>

	<p>Further simplified the default settings in
	<code>DependencyFinder</code> and <code>query.jsp</code>.
	The new defaults print the entire package-to-package
	dependency graph, as opposed to the entire graph like
	it was doing before.  This is so that new users, as they
	start using the interface, can simply launch a query and
	see something useful without using all the memory available
	to render an immense graph.</p>

	<p>I will expand the manual to include a tutorial with
	sample queries and their results.</p>

	<p>There was a rendering problem for <code>JTable</code>
	under JDK 1.3.  I try to group rows in bands of three with
	alternating background colors.  For some reason, under JDK
	1.3, the cells in column 0 would not get the right background
	sometimes.  This problem is gone under JDK 1.4.  Since this
	is not breaking any functionality (it is just annoying), I
	will recommend that you upgrade your JVM if it bothers you.</p>

	<p>I'm dropping support for JDK 1.2.2.  I upgraded my
	JDK 1.3 from 1.3.1_01 to 1.3.1_05.  I also started playing
	with JDK 1.4.</p>

	<p>This is interesting, now.  JDK 1.4 ships with some basic
	XML support, including a version of Xerces.  But it looks
	like it's an older version than the one I'm using, because
	it requires me to explicitly specify the system property
	<code>org.xml.sax.driver</code>.  I need to dig further to
	figure out which version they're shipping and how I can
	force it to use the lastest Xerces that I ship with
	Dependency Finder.  Maybe some day, in the far future, when
	I don't support JDK 1.3 anymore, I can stop shipping Xerces
	with Dependency Finder altogether.  But for now, I'm stuck.</p>

	<p>Maybe I can weasel out of it by requiring users to install
	JAXP 1.2 from Sun.  The documentation claims that JDK 1.4
	ships with JAXP 1.1.  Maybe JAXP 1.2 uses something close to
	the lastest Xerces; and it also includes Xalan!  I will
	investigate further.</p>

	<p>Also, the compiler in JDK 1.4 behaves slightly differently
	from the one in JDK 1.3.  The result is that the unit tests
	are breaking because the compiled classes don't have the
	same number of features.  I will have to either revert back
	to JDK 1.3 or update the unit tests.  I haven't quite decided
	yet, but I'm leaning towards the latter.</p>

	<p>I also seems that JDK 1.4 has problems with Log4J too.
	More on this later.</p>

	<p>Upgraded the following development components:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Xerces</td>
	        <td>:</td>
		<td>2.1.0</td>
	        <td>-></td>

	<p>I did a quick check to see if I can still compile
	Dependency Finder with JDK 1.2.2, but I can't anymore.
	I use <code>java.util.Collections.singletonList()</code> in
	<code>com.jeantessier.commandline.MultipleValuesSwitch</code>
	and a new constructor for
	<code>javax.swing.JRadioButtonMenuItem</code> in
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.gui.DependencyFinder</code>
	that takes an instance of
	<code>javax.swing.Action</code>.  Given the context in
	which these happen, I don't see how I can write around
	them in a clean way.</p>

	<p>So I'm probably just going to drop support of JDK
	1.2.2 and ask people to use Dependency Finder with
	JDK 1.3 and above.</p>

	<p>Everybody at work is asking how to use Dependency
	Finder.  I guess I need to work on usability and the
	intuitiveness of the user interface.</p>

	<p>Also, maybe the default settings should not try to
	print the whole dependency graph.  The two instances my
	colleague deployed have over 50,000 nodes and the JVM
	runs out of memory trying to render them.  A think a
	default of package-to-package dependencies might be
	better.</p>

	<p>Here, I need to choose between default settings that
	make it non-threatening to newbies versus settings that
	people use most of the time, so the tool is quick to use,
	without having to flip the same switches all the time.</p>

	They pointed out that I violate an XSLT rule when I reference
	validator instances in <code>match</code> clauses of
	<code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> tags.  It has been working
	until now because Xalan is lenient, but there is no guarantee
	that it will do so in the future or that the stylesheet will
	work with another XSLT translator.  I will need to rewrite

	<p>I used the Inherited Behavior design pattern to normalize
	the handling of attributes across implementations of the
	<code>com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor</code> interface.
	This solved the bug, but I had to change the DTD for
	classfiles.  I don't know how that will impact validity
	of outputs once I change it the the web site that the tools
	point to by default.</p>

	<p>I worked out the problem with
	<code>PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl</code>.  If I use the full
	notation for Xalan extensions instead of the abbreviated
	one for Java, it works just fine, even with Xalan 2.4.0.
	So I will upgrade back to Xalan 2.4.0.  I opened a bug
	with the Xalan folks:

	changes on on to specify extensions.  The release notes

	Journal</a>.  The tool is called
	<a href="http://thesmallworlds.com/">Small Worlds</a> and it
	sells for around $1,750.  The screenshots are really nice.</p>

	<p>I need to write to JDJ, maybe get an article out of it.
	And I need to follow up on Martin Fowler and Bob Martin too.</p>

	<p>I put (most of) the website in CVS as a new module.</p>

	<p>I also had an idea for a possible layout of classes, by
	package, for a dependency graph.  Classes in a package are layed
	out in a circle, forming a cluster.  The clusters are they layed
	out in a larger circle.  This way, one can zoom in on a cluster
	to explore dependencies within a package.  If you zoom out far
	enough, inter-package dependencies dominate and packages with
	lots of dependencies stand out.</p>

	name, and a field name?  The answer will drive how far the
	prefix match has to go.</p>

	<p>I have an idea.  I will have <code>ListDocumentedElements</code>
	mark each entry with a suffix in "<code> [P]</code>",
	"<code> [M]</code>", or "<code> [F]</code>".  Then, in
	<code>ListBasedValidator</code>, I will trim it off.  That
	will take care of <code>JarJarDiff</code> and the XSL
	transformations.  Then, in <code>ListDiffPrinter</code>,

	dependencies from the static initilizer to features show up as
	class-to-feature dependencies, something I said in the manual
	did not exist.  Now I must decide if I'm gonna amend the
	documentation or treat the static initializer like a feature.

	<p>Worked on simplifying the UI in the web application.  Both
	<code>query.jsp</code> and <code>closure.jsp</code> now have
	a simple and an advanced form.  The advanced form has all the
	options whereas the simple form only takes regular expressions
	that apply to all packages, classes, and features.  I'm thinking
	of relying on external cascading stylesheets, but I have to
	check about browser support.  I suppose this is not really an
	issue anymore, but I'll check anyway.</p>

	<p>Added <code>dtd-prefix</code> switch to commands that

	DTDs when they are disconnected from the Internet.  The

	<p><code>ListDiff</code> can now compress the resulting list.
	This means that if, for instance, a class is in a list, it
	will remove entries for methods of that class from the list.
	The same goes for packages and their classes.  Just call it
	with the <code>compress</code> switch.</p>

	<p>I changed the published list to use with
	<code>PublishedDiffToHTML</code>.  It makes more sense to use
	the old list, since the goal is to notify customers of the
	changes that possibly break backwards compatibility.</p>

	<p>I'm not gonna make it.  I wanted to finish the first

	not done with the coding and there is a lot of documentation

	whole thing properly.  I've updated the release plan
	accordingly.</p>

	<p>Worked on dependency-related metrics.  I think I've got
	it nailed down, but I need to write more tests.</p>

	<p>Made progress with SLOC.  Methods are pretty good.
	Fields are accounted for.  I've added one for the class

	<p>Changed the default self-disposition of

	turns out that in my attempt yesterday, I had changed the

	<p>You can now expand <code>AccumulatorMeasurement</code>
	values when using the <code>-expand</code> switch with the
	<code>-txt</code> switch to <code>OOMetrics</code>.</p>

	<p>Fixed <code>-verbose</code> and <code>-trace</code>
	switches on all executables.</p>

	<p>Fixed a bug in <code>SumMeasurement</code> when dealing
	with <code>StatisticalMeasurement</code> and empty lines.</p>

	<p>Allow group definitions to be defined by multiple
	regular expressions.</p>

	<p>Used <code>SumMeasurement</code> to compute SLOC on classes
	as the sum of SLOC on submetrics + 1.  I still need to figure
	out how to ignore counts for synthetic elements and add
	abstract methods and <code>try {</code> lines.</p>

	<p>Added a <code>TableCellRenderer</code> to the
	<code>JTable</code> instances in <code>OOMetricsGUI</code>
	to draw out-of-bound measurements in red.  I also tried
	to set the background to create bands of three rows of
	alternating colors, but is is not working perfectly yet.</p>

	<p>Added a <i>new metrics</i> tool to <code>OOMetricsGUI</code>
	to reset the list of measurements.</p>

	<p>Measurements in the configuration file can now be made
	invisible via an XML attribute on <code>&lt;measurement&gt;</code>
	tags.</p>

	<p>I tried to change the default self-disposition of
	<code>StatisticalMeasurement</code> to average values, but it
	behaved strangely by ignoring itself instead.  Strange!  I
	also tried to have separate renderer classes for
	<code>StatisticalMeasurement</code> and the other subclasses
	of <code>MeasurementBase</code>, but that also didn't quite
	work out.  More on that later ... maybe.</p>

	<p>Fixed a mistyped measurement in <code>MetricsConfig.xml</code>.</p>

	<p>Addressed a possible performance issue which
	<code>com.jeantessier.metrics.XMLPrinter</code> where using
	four spaces for indent was yielding <i>huge</i> XML reports.
	I changed <code>OOMetrics</code> to use a tab character
	instead.  We'll see how it goes.  At the same time, I adjusted
	<code>XMLPrinter</code> to generate &lt;measurement&gt;
	nodes instead of &lt;metric&gt;.  It will also ignore
	<code>NullMeasurement</code> instances from here on.</p>

	<p>Use the system property <code>line.separator</code>
	instead of "\n" in metrics reports.  This should help with
	cross-platform portability.</p>

	<p>Rigged <code>MetricsFactory</code> to handle group
	definitions properly.</p>

	<p>I've been looking at using tool tips in the header of the
	result tables in <code>OOMetricsGUI</code> to expand the
	measurement names.  Each header has an associated
	<code>JComponent</code>, but getting to is is proving
	rather difficult.  I'd almost have to provide a custom
	implementation of <code>TableColumnModel</code>, but I
	only need to override a tiny piece of the behavior.  More

	This is gonna take a while ...</p>

	<p>The optional validation was not enough when working in a
	disconnected environment.  It still tried to load the DTD,
	even though it was not using it to validate the document.
	I've used an Apache feature to turn off loading of external
	DTDs when validation is turned off.  It now works fine.</p>

	<p>Next, it is time to fix SLOC and dependency metrics.  Then

	people understand the various targets.  I also managed to
	use the &lt;ant&gt; task to compile the <code>JarJarDiff</code>
	test samples.</p>

	<p>I realized that the combination of a validating parser
	with remove DTDs might not work when disconnected from
	the Web.  So I made the validating behavior optional in
	<code>com.jeantessier.dependency.NodeLoader</code> and in
	the <code>DependencyReporter</code> CLI application.</p>

	<p>I upgraded all the scripts to use the new Xerces JAR

	<p>I was not happy with the way that most measurements
	inherited from <code>MeasurementBase</code> and implemented
	<code>NumericalMeasurement</code>.  This led to a lot of
	duplicate code and the resulting class diagram was hard
	to read.  So I created <code>NumericalMeasurementBase</code>
	to store the common code and provided some sensible default
	method implementations in both abstract classes.  Now, there
	is no longer any duplicated code and the class diagram is
	simple and obvious.</p>

	<p>I finally figured out my problem with Xerces and unit tests.
	The Xerces and JUnit's class loading behavior do not play well

	file so that Xerces files are not reloaded with every test run.</p>

	<p>I finished <code>MetricsConfigurationHandler</code>.  In the
	unit tests, I tried to test Xerces's XML validation feature.
	It load the external DTD, alright, but fails to flag documents
	that do not follow the DTD.  So much for that.</p>

	<p>To use the validating parser, I had to put the DTDs on:</p>

	<p>I have been looking at the <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code>

	now that the resolution has gone down to the feature level.
	I have noticed that the <code>match</code> expression for
	<code>class</code> nodes has exceeded some internal buffer in
	Xalan.  If a add a few characters, I get an

	<p>I am almost done with new features to <code>JarJarDiff</code>!</p>

	<p>I fixed all the unit tests and the XSL stylesheets.  In the

	<code>ClassDifferences</code> when adding decorators.</p>

	<p><code>DiffToExternal</code> may need additional tweaking.  I
	also need an new XSL stylesheet to extract the documentation
	level information from all the other differences.</p>

	<p>First shot at tracking documentation levels using
	<code>JarJarDiff</code>.</p>

	<p>After looking at the format used by Argo/UML to save UML project
	files, I'm having renewed interest in XMI to import dependency
	graph into UML modeling tools.  This would allow people to draw
	the graph visually using their favorite UML tool.  Argo/UML also
	uses PGML to store graphics.  This has led to W3C to standardize
	SVG, which I might be looking into in the future.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 31, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>I finished the reorganization of the <code>Differences</code>
	hierarchy for the Decorator pattern.  I have made this change to
	ease listing of documentation status changes.  Come to think of
	it, I might not have needed this change to do the new feature.</p>

	<p>I have added some documentation for <code>JarJarDiff</code>
	in preparation for the new feature..</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>

    <dt>
	March 27, 2002
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>I reorganized the <code>Differences</code> hierarchy to
	make room for a Decorator pattern.  I'm reimplementing tracking
	of deprecated features to arrange the code.  After that, I'll
	be better able to take care of documented vs. undocumented
	programming elements.</p>

	<p>Right now, I've broken something.  I don't have the adequate
	unit tests to tell me what it is that I broke.  I guess I've
	been a bad boy.  This will take a little while to fix.</p>

	<p>I am rediscovering the <code>com.jeantessier.diff</code>

    <dt>

	<p>That validation list is still giving me headaches.  How can I
	make that feature fit without breaking the <i>purity</i> of my
	code so far?  :-)</p>

	<code>extract.jsp</code>, hoping this will prevent lengthy
	extractions from happening by accident.</p>

    <dd>
	<p>I have regained control over <code>DiffToExternalHTML</code>.</p>

	<p>With finer control over validation, how the validation list
	is generated and used becomes more and more important.  If we use
	javadoc comments, and we want to track when things transition
	from valid to invalid or vice versa, we now need a list for the
	old version and a list for the new version.  How these two lists
	are combined and used remains to be determined.  Should they be
	fed to <code>JarJarDiff</code> and merged into the XML output?
	Should they be fed to the XSL stylesheet, making it even more
	convoluted?  And what about <code>DiffToHTML.xsl</code>?  Should
	it start to use Java code too?</p>

	<p>I streamlined <code>Diff.dtd</code> to remove duplicated
	information in the output of <code>JarJarDiff</code>.</p>

	<p>I wrote <code>ListBasedValidator</code> and I have
	<code>ListVisibleElements</code>, a doclet for listing programming
	elements that have been flagged through their javadoc comments.
	This way, one can use javadoc tags to flag classes and features
	as part of the published API and guide <code>DiffToExternalHTML</code>
	to limit the report to those classes and features.</p>

	<p>I got rid of the previous <code>DiffToHTML.xsl</code> and

	the product's name to the template and redesigned the title line.
	I added it to <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code> too.  I'm
	thinking of making that one simply an XML filter and use the new
	<code>DiffToHTML.xsl</code> for all rendering.  But I will need
	to figure out how to efficiently copy XML trees in XSLT.</p>

	<p>I modified the <code>com.jeantessier.classreader</code> package
	so that <code>ClassfileLoader</code> can notify listeners as soon
	as a <code>.class</code> file is loaded.  This way, tools like

	<code>TransientClassfileLoader</code> since it does not need the

	<p>I need a release plan.  I've had a number of ideas lately for
	new features and I need to scope what's doable and what's not,
	and have some idea of when I can expect the release.</p>

	<p>I fixed <code>TransitiveClosure</code>.  I also added to it a
	feature where it can now follow inbound dependencies in addition
	to outbound ones.  Maybe this will become handy somehow.  I'm
	thinking of limiting the depth of the closure exploration, though.
	And finally, it now has two modes of operation: one where it only
	records the first dependency that led to a <code>Node</code>, and
	another where it records all such paths.</p>

	<p>I adjusted the code so that Log4J is initialized from
	<code>log4.properties</code> located on the <code>CLASSPATH</code>.
	I thought about putting the file in <code>DependencyFinder.jar</code>,
	but decided against.  If someone is familiar with Log4J, they can
	edit the configuration file and adjust logging to their liking.
	It took a lot of hard work to figure it out.  I had to follow all
	the steps below, pretty much in that order:</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>RTFM</li>
	    <li>RTFM</li>
	    <li>RTFM :-)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I temporarily removed <code>xerces.jar</code> and <code>xalan.jar</code>
	from the web application WAR file.  This dramatically reduced its size.
	I also added <code>deploy</code> and <code>undeploy</code> targets to
	the <code>build.xml</code> file for Tomcat.</p>

	February 03, 2002

    <dd>
	<p>I adjusted <code>GraphCopier</code> and <code>GraphSummarizer</code>
	to reduce the noise in their scope output.  They used to output the
	whole package of any node that was in scope.  This often produced extra
	output that would obscure the answer to the query.</p>

	<p>The new <code>GraphCopier</code> maintains a separate <code>NodeFactory</code>
	for scoped nodes and filtered nodes.  Only nodes in the scope are
	created using the scoping <code>NodeFactory</code>.  This cuts away
	a lot of extraneous information.</p>

	<p>This has unfortunately broken <code>TransitiveClosure</code>.</p>

		<b><code>name</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		A user-friendly name for the codebase.  This allows

		without revealing where it is on the server's file
		system.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>source</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		The compiled Java code to to be extracted.  You can
		specify multiple locations by separating them with
		commas.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>mode</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		Wether to maximize or minimize the graph, or leave
		it in raw form.
	    </dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The application consists of only two JSPs:</p>

	<dl>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>extract.jsp</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		Extracts the dependency graph from the source specified
		by <code>application.getInitParameter("source")</code>.
		The graph will further be processed based on
		<code>application.getInitParameter("mode")</code>.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>
		<b><code>query.jsp</code></b>
	    </dt>
	    <dd>
		Displays a subset of the dependency graph, according
		to the user-specified scope and filter.

	<p>This being said, I still need to work out the

	<p>I removed trace statements from

	In tests with <code>JT.jar</code> and <code>DependencyFinder.jar</code>,

	<p><code>OOMetricsGUI</code> is a Swing GUI put on top of
	<code>OOMetrics</code>.  It resulted in the creation of the
	<code>jt.swing</code> package to hold generic classes for
	Swing applications.</p>

	<p>The next step is to be able to sort on arbitrary columns.
	I must also integrate it with <code>DependencyFinder</code>.</p>

	<p>I fixed a problem with inner classes.  <code>OOMetrics</code> was
	counting all inner class entries in the InnerClasses class attribute.
	This included references to inner classes in other classes, resulting
	in a count that was higher than reality.  It now restricts itself to
	actual inner classes of the current class, resulting in the correct
	count.</p>

	<p>I also adjusted how the <code>jt.classreader.Classfile</code>
	constructor writes trace entries about its constant pool.  This way,
	the text of the pool gets generated only if there is a log object to
	print it.  I'm expecting a 25% improvement in performance as this
	involves quite a bit of conversions when printing the entries in the
	constant pool.</p>

	<p>I also fixed a bug in <code>OOMetrics</code> so that it now uses the
	<code>-project-name</code> command line switch instead of
	<code>-project</code> to determine the project's name in reports.</p>

	<p>For a while now, I have been less than pleased at having to
	operate on maximized graphs.  I revised	<code>jt.dependency.GraphCopier</code>
	to make <code>jt.dependency.GraphSummarizer</code>.  The latter
	explores the graph more fully to compensate for the sparseness of the
	graph.  This modification will shorten the time it takes to read the graph,
	but queries will take longer to process.  Usage in the field will tell which
	mode works best on real projects, whether it is <i>normal</i>, <i>minimized</i>,
	or <i>maximized</i>.  I had to retrofit <code>DependencyReporter</code>,
	<code>DependencyMetrics</code>, and <code>DependencyFinder</code> and give
	them the appropriate switches.</p>

	<p>I found a bug in <code>jt.dependency.CodeDependencyCollector</code>

	<p>In order to fix this bug, I revisited
	<code>jt.classreader.VisitorBase</code> to build in default
	behavior that explores all parts of the classfile structure.</p>

	<p>I also modified <code>DependencyFinder</code> to include

	<p>I fixed a bug in <code>jt.metrics.MetricsGatherer</code>
	that caused a <code>NullPointerException</code> when analyzing
	<code>java.lang.Object</code>.  It also skewed Depth of Inheritance
	metrics.</p>

	<p>I also fixed a bug when processing static class initializers.
	They were getting attached to a noname class in the default
	package.  Parsing the name correctly fixed the problem.</p>

	<p>I might have to have two sets of parsed classes, one for
	analysis and the other for support classes.  This is in order
	to correctly compute the Depth of Inheritance metric.</p>

	<p>I need to modify <code>jt.metrics.ui.OOMetrics</code> so that
	it parses all classes before starting the analysis.  Right now,
	it parses and analyzes each parameter on the command-line
	separately.</p>

	<p>I adjusted the display of ratio metrics in

	<p>I now use instances of <code>java.text.NumberFormat</code> in
	<code>jt.metrics.PrettyPrinter</code> to adjust the display of
	numbers.</p>

	<p>I played with using <code>Jikes</code> to compile the code
	instead of <code>javac</code>, but the difference in compile
	time was not worth the extra warnings (4 secs vs. 10 secs).</p>

	<p>I now use the default compiler mode in <code>javac</code>,
	<code>modern</code>, instead of <code>classic</code>.  I hope
	this won't break the compatibility with JDK 1.2 VMs.</p>

	<p>It's been a while, but I've been preparing an OO metrics module.
	Right now, it is only available as a command-line utility named
	<code>OOMetrics</code>.  It is very unstable and not all metrics
	are computed yet.  Output is either text, <code>.csv</code> file,
	or XML.  I will eventually have XSL stylesheets to format the XML
	output.  I will also eventually incorporate it in
	<code>DependencyFinder</code>.</p>

	<p>I added PC counter information to the trace information from
	<code>jt.classreader.Code_attribute</code>.</p>

	<p>I fixed a bug in <code>jt.dependency.PrettyPrinter</code>.  It was
	not collecting dependencies correctly when they were between
	different kinds of nodes (e.g., feature to class).</p>

	<p>There was a bug with <code>jt.dependency.LinkMinimizer</code>.

	<p>When attempting to locate a feature, the code now looks at
	implemented interfaces too.  <code>ClassDifferences</code> will
	use this for all fields and only for methods between classes or
	between interfaces.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>A field removed from an interface or from a class will only
	be showed as removed if it cannot be obtained from a superclass
	or supported interface.</li>
	<li>A method removed from an interface will only be showed as
	removed if it cannot be obtrained from a supported interface
	(superinterface).</li>
	<li>A constructor or method removed from a class will only be
	showed as removed if it cannot be obtrained from a superclass.
	It will not consider a matching method that would be obtained
	from an interfaces, since this interface would not provide an
	implementation for that method.</li>

    <dd>
	<p>I adjsuted <code>JarJarDiff</code> so that when it detects a
	feature that has been removed, it looks in the superclasses of
	the class for a matching signature or proper visibility.  This
	can happen when refactoring pushes a method up the inheritance
	tree.  The method is no longer in the class, but it can still
	be visible if it was declared <code>public</code> or
	<code>protected</code>.  The XML node gets a new attribute to
	indicate that a removed feature is now inherited.  The XSL
	stylesheet can then choose to ignore the removed feature, if it
	wants to.</p>

	<p>I've added a tool called <code>DiffToInheritanceChange</code>

	<p>Renamed the <code>JarDiff</code> tool to <code>JarJarDiff</code>,

	one for text, yet.</p>

	<p>I've added a tool to compute the transitive closure of elements.
	It is named <code>DependencyClosure</code>.  If creates a sub-graph
	of the dependency graph by following outbound dependencies.  By
	starting on one class, you can find out all the classes that are
	used directly or indirectly by that class.  It uses the same scoping
	and filtering engine as <code>DependencyReporter</code>.</p>

	<p>I've added another tool to compute dependency statistics, such
	as the number of inbound vs. outbound links.  It is named

	be refactored to produce XML, and then use XSL stylesheets

        <p>I tweaked <code>CodeDependencyCollector</code> to process
	<code>new</code>, <code>anewarray</code>, <code>checkcast</code>,
	<code>instanceof</code>, and <code>multianewarray</code> opcodes.
	It doesn't seem to add any dependencies that were not already
	found by just looking at field access and method call instructions,
	but maybe this is just a quirk of my code.</p>

	<p>I need to adjust the <code>.bat</code> files so that they
	are no longer tied to my environment.  I'll create a
	<code>DEPENDENCYFINDER_HOME</code> environment variable,
	this way people only need to set that variable to start
	using the tools.  Eventually, I could look at some kind of
	InstallShield or InstallAnywhere solution.</p>

	<p>I also want to create some additional implementations of the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader.Visitor</code>
	interface to compute software metrics, such as:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>number of packages, classes, methods</li>
	    <li>number of classes per package or methods per class</li>
	    <li>number of public, static, or synthetic classes or features (i.e., fields and methods)</li>
	    <li>...</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I could do the same with additional implementations of the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.model.Visitor</code>
	interface to compute software metrics, such as:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>number of outbound dependencies per package, class, or feature</li>
	    <li>number of inbound dependencies per package, class, or feature</li>
	    <li>...</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For these last dependency metrics, the tools should be applicable to
	the output of both <code>DependencyExtractor</code> and
	<code>DependencyReporter</code>, so that scoping can be used without
	duplicating the functionality in <code>DependencyReporter</code>.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>After running the tools on themselves, I reorganized
	the package hierarchy and simplified it greatly.</p>

        <p>I added XSL stylesheets for converting dependency graphs
	to text and HTML.  Each stylesheet has three version:</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>Whole graph</li>
	    <li>List only outbound dependencies (show nodes that are dependent on others)</li>
	    <li>List only inbound dependencies (show dependable nodes, i.e., depended upon)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I added shorthand options to <code>DependencyReporter</code>.
	I also added shorthand <code>.bat</code> files.</p>

	<p>I adjusted <code>DependencyExtractor</code> to scan the
	bytecode using <code>CodeDependencyCollector</code> instead
	of limiting itself to traversing the constant pool and looking
	at signatures.</p>

	<p>I refactored <code>Collector</code>, making it an interface
	with a base implementation (<code>CollectorBase</code>) and
	creating an inheritance ladder with <code>Visitor</code>.</p>

	<p>I found yet another bug with <code>byte</code> as a signed type.
	There may be others still waiting to manifest themselves.</p>

        <p>Added a script for doing XSL Transformations.  It uses
	Apache's Xalan.  Now all I need are some XSL stylesheets.</p>

	<p><code>DependencyReporter</code> is working fine, except
	that the command-line is starting to exceed DOS limits.
	I will need to create an XML configuration document if
	I want to process complex queries.</p>

	<p>I fixed <code>DependencyExtractor</code> so that it can
	read from JAR and Zip files.</p>

	<p>I found yet another bug caused by things use index 0 in
	the constant pool to represent special cases.  There may be
	others still waiting to manifest themselves.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 28, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Simplified the command-line interfaces to the major
	tools (<code>DependencyExtractor</code> and
	<code>DependencyReporter</code>).</p>

	<p>Fixed <code>Reporter</code> to assume it is operating
	on a maximized graph.  This simplifies the processing and
	minimizes traversals.  This might have also solved the
	printing problems I was experiencing.</p>

	<p>Fixed a bug where a feature could get a dependency
	on its class or package, and vice versa.  The same
	thing was happening between classes and packages.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 27, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added the <code>CodeIterator</code> class in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package.  This allows me to traverse bytecode and capture
	dependencies originating from methods.  I have yet to figure
	out exactly how to use it.  I'm thinking of writing a
	new <code>DependencyCollector</code> to do all the
	collecting, instead of the current two step class then
	feature collection.</p>

	<p>Added the <code>Reporter</code> class in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.model.Visitor</code>
	hierarchy.  This allows me to build a <code>Node</code>
	graph from the dependency graph which answers queries
	such as package-to-package dependencies and the like.
	I've adjusted <code>DependencyReporter</code> to make
	use of this new class.  There are still problems with
	displaying scopes of other things than packages, but it
	should be easy to solve.</p>

	<p>The interfaces to <code>DependencyExtractor</code> and
	<code>DependencyReporter</code> need work to make them
	easier to use.</p>

	<p>I must fix the deserialization bug in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader.Classfile</code>
	package.</p>

	<p>I must also make the whole
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader.Classfile</code>
	easier to use for general purposes (i.e., Jeff).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 21, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added the <code>ClassfileLoader</code> hierarchy in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package.  This allows me to read from <code>.class</code>
	files from a directory tree, from a JAR file, or from a
	Zip files.</p>

	<p>Right now, the loaders load and parse everything in
	the constructors.  I need to enhance these classes to
	do lazy loading and provide a list of the entries they
	contain.  Whether these entries will be file names or
	class names is not decided yet.</p>

	<p>I also need to enhance the classes in the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package to provide better navigation and query mechanisms
	in the <code>Classfile</code>-rooted structure.  I need to
	be able to pull methods and fields by name rather than
	iterate through the collections.  I need to simple query
	methods when looking for tagging attributes such as
	<code>Synthetic_attribute</code> or <code>Deprecated_attribute</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 20, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added a SAX parser for reading the dependency
	<a href="Components.html#xml">XML format</a>, using Xerces
	from Apache.</p>

	<p>Added an embryonic <code>DependencyReporter</code> tool.
	I'm thinking of having this tools output some form of XML
	and then use XSLT to convert it to whatever I need.  I
	would most likely use Apache's Xalan for that.</p>

	<p>I'm also thinking of another tool that would create
	a file hierarchy that mirrors the one from <code>javadoc</code>.
	This way, I could embed dependency information in the
	automatically generated documentation.  Each class comments
	could include a hyperlink to a local file with the dependencies
	for that class.  The same would go for packages.</p>

	<p>I also need to figure a way to read <code>.class</code>
	from JAR files, in addition to directories.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 16, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Renamed the extraction tool from
	<code>DependencyFinder</code> to
	<code>DependencyExtractor</code>.</p>

	<p>Added <code>LinkMinimizer</code> and
	<code>LinkMaximizer</code> visitors to control the
	size of the dependency graph.  <code>LinkMinimizer</code>
	removes redundant edges while <code>LinkMaximizer</code>
	replicates edges.  The minimal graphs gives a more compact
	representation, but traversal can be slowed down.  The
	full graph takes up more space, but its traversal will
	be more efficient when computing metrics such as
	aggregated package dependencies.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 14, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Refactored the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.model</code>
	pacakge to have a <code>Node</code> hierarchy and
	<code>Visitor</code> classes.  This way, I will be
	able to use visitors to implement reporting functions
	in Java.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	February 13, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added <code>DirectoryExplorer</code> and the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.model</code>
	package.  The new <code>DependencyFinder</code>
	tool either prints the <i>forest of packages</i>
	or the burgeoning <a href="Components.html#xml">XML output</a>.</p>

        <p>We may have a problem with inlined code.  Features
	marked as <code>public static final</code> do not
	show up.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>Regarding the need for compiling in debug mode
	(<code>-g</code> switch).  This is required in order to
	capture dependencies created by the type of local variables
	in methods.  The compiler verifies the legality of type
	assignements and then discards the type information.
	When the compiler is called with <code>-g</code>, it
	keeps the type information to create the <code>LocalVariableTable</code>
	attribute of <code>Code</code> attributes.  If the
	assignement is legal, then it meets all the dependency
	requirements.  It either uses the same dependency, or creates
	a new one which is more restrictive than the initial
	dependency (i.e., it transitively includes the former).
	Dependencies are not automatically considered transitive,
	but in this case they are.  It is therefore acceptable
	to ignore the dropped dependency.  If someone really
	wants to see it, he or she simply has to compile the
	code using <code>-g</code> and run the dependency
	finder again.</p>

        <p>I should consider turning this into an Ant task.</p>

        <p>What if I used a <code>ClassLoader</code> instead to
	trap class requests as the target class is being
	resolved?  The good thing about looking at the
	<code>.class</code> file only is that I don't need to
	have all the dependencies on the <code>CLASSPATH</code>
	at the time.</p>

	<p>I looked at the classes used by <code>javac</code>
	and it appears to be a mess.  I'll stick with my things
	for now.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>I reinstated the Visitor pattern in the
	<code>jt.dependencygenerator.classreader</code>
	package with a vengeance.  It turned out to
	be useful in other areas of the <code>.class</code>
	file as well.  Visitors can now explore the
	whole <code>.class</code> file, including fields,
	methods, and attributes.</p>

	<p>I moved the <code>ClassReader</code> tool from the
	<code>jt.dependencygenerator.classreader</code>
	package to the <code>jt.dependencygenerator.tools</code>
	package.</p>

	<p>The extractor now reads the entire <code>.class</code>
	file.</p>

	<p>It has problems reading from compressed JAR files.
	It seems to be OK with uncompressed ones.  Maybe I can
	use the <code>java.util.jar</code> package to read the
	whole byte stream in memory before starting the processing.</p>

	<p>Handed a copy of the code to Jeff Chan.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>

    <dd>
        <p>I broke out the package and got rid of the Visitor
	pattern in the
	<code>jt.dependencygenerator.classreader</code>
	package because I had only one simple visitable
	object.</p>

	<p>The extractor only reads from the constant pool,
	which only holds references to methods that are
	called and fields that are accessed.  Each field
	and method entry later in the <code>.class</code>
	file maintains its own index to the name and
	descriptor (i.e., signature) in the constant pool.</p>

	<p>I must parse deeper in the <code>.class</code>
	file to extract field and method entries and
	get the references I need from there.</p>

	<p>I must also make sure that I capture dependences
	from local variables in methods!</p>

	<p>Fran&ccedil;ois is looking for a JAR
	comparison tool to analyze differences between two
	versions of a given JAR file.  Once I've tuned the
	<code>.class</code> file parser, we could use it to
	extract API information from JAR files.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	January 30, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>The extractor is half-way done.  The current version
	is not very good at keeping track of which signatures
	are really useful, and I'm not very happy with the
	large <code>switch()</code> statements.</p>
