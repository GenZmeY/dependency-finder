<title>Dependency Finder - A vs. I</title>

<h2>A vs. I</h2>

<p>This is a quick analysis of A vs. I graphs for some of
the software used in Dependency Finder.  I took these
graphs from
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.PDF">Design Principles and Design Patterns</a>
by Robert C. Martin of Object Mentor, Inc.</p>

<p>I collected the values for <code>D'</code> using
<code>OOMetrics</code> with the Martin configuration. I
then used a special XSL stylesheet to extract the value
from the XML output and feed it to MS Excel.  The
following graphs are simple plotting of these values,
sorted in ascending order.</p>

<p>E.g.,</p>

<pre>
    OOMetrics -configuration etc\MartinConfig.xml -xml -out df lib\DependencyFinder.jar
</pre>

<table cellspacing="3">
    <tr>
	<td><img src="images/ORODs.gif"    alt="Values of D' for Jakarta-ORO" /></td>
	<td><img src="images/Log4JDs.gif"  alt="Values of D' for Log4J" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><img src="images/XercesDs.gif" alt="Values of D' for Xerces" /></td>
	<td><img src="images/XalanDs.gif"  alt="Values of D' for Xalan" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td colspan="2" align="center"><img src="images/DependencyFinderDs.gif" alt="Values of D' for Dependency Finder" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The goal, here, is to keep values of <code>D'</code>
as close to zero as possible.  So from these graphs,
this means keeping the extreme values closer to the central
axis, like ORO and Log4J.</p>

<p>I used a simple Perl script to compute the value
distributions.  It rounded each value of <code>D'</code>
to the nearest 0.1 increment and then couunted how many
points fell on each of the 21 target values.  The graphs
below show the distribution of values of <code>D'</code>
across the range -1 to 1.  I normalized the values by
dividing each count by the total number of packages in
a given piece of software so that we can compare the
distributions regardless of the size of the software
under inspection.</p>

<table cellspacing="3">
    <tr>
	<td><img src="images/ORODistribution.gif"    alt="Distribution of D' for Jakarta-ORO" /></td>
	<td><img src="images/Log4JDistribution.gif"  alt="Distribution of D' for Log4J" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><img src="images/XercesDistribution.gif" alt="Distribution of D' for Xerces" /></td>
	<td><img src="images/XalanDistribution.gif"  alt="Distribution of D' for Xalan" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td colspan="2" align="center"><img src="images/DependencyFinderDistribution.gif" alt="Distribution of D' for Dependency Finder" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Keeping up with our goal of keeping values of
<code>D'</code> as close to zero as possible, this
translates into a large spike at 0 and short wings
to each side, again like ORO and Log4J.</p>

<p>Finally, a summary view of all five codebases.
The thin line shows the full range of <code>D'</code>
for that codebase.  The large while square is
centered on the statistical mean and spreads each
way by one standard deviation.  Statistically,
about 65% of all values fall within the square.
The column below each range shows how many packages
are in each codebase.</p>

<p>Final lesson: I guess Dependency Finder is not
faring too badly, but for something so small, it
could still have done better.  :-)</p>
