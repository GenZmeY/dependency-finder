<h2>Goal</h2>

The goal of this project is to have a tool, or suite of
tools, that can extract class dependencies from compiled Java
code.  The tools can get all the necessary information out
of the <code>.class</code> files.</p>

<p>Many authors have stressed the importance of managing
depencencies (
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/listArticles?key=author&author=Robert%20C.%20Martin">Robert C. Martin</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633620/o/qid=980962318/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/105-0176284-9920776">John Lakos</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/coupling.pdf">Martin Fowler</a>).
Managing
dependencies means securing encapsulation and making sure
that the code follows the architecture.  It is also
essential for the modularization of code and favors reuse.
By extracting the information from the code itself, we can
detect where we were sloppy, where we took shortcuts that
we shouldn't have.  Managing the dependencies can
shorten the compilation time of the code.</p>

<p>At first, I thought of using the Reflection API, but
it shows only the class's attributes and method signatures.
If a method uses some other class for a local variable or
to call a static method, that dependency that will not
show under the Reflection API.</p>
