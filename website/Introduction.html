Code analysis, API diffs, OO metrics ...</p>

<h2>Dependency Finder</h2>

<p>Dependency Finder is a suite of tools for analyzing
compiled Java code.  At the center of it is a powerful
dependency analysis application to extract dependency
graphs and mine them for useful information.  This
application in multiple forms for maximum usability,
including command-line tools, a Swing-based application,
a web application ready to be deployed in an application
server, and a set of Ant tasks.</p>

<p>JarJarDiff is another important tool in the suite.
It compares two versions of the same code and reports
on differences in their API.  It lists new, changed, and
removed elements such as packages, classes, methods, and
more.  You can tailor the reports to focus on the public,
published API versus the private, internal one.</p>

<p>Finally, Dependency Finder has a tool for computing
object-oriented software metrics that give you an empirical
quality assessment of your code.  Once again, you can
tailor the report to focus on the metrics that you care
about and adjust validity threshold to the specifics of
your project.</p>

<h3>Why Dependency Finder over the alternatives</h3>

<p>Dependency Finder is not the only game in town.  Tools
like IntelliJ and Xrefactory have great features that let
you track down usage of selected classes or methods.  So
why should you bother with yet another tool?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>By the way, I keep an informal list of the competition
on the <a href="Resources.html">resources</a> page.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters, Dependency Finder is <b>free</b>.  Free as
in "free beer" since it costs no money; and free as in "free
speech" since you can get the sources and do whatever you
want with them (except take my name off).</p>

<p>Dependency Finder has a <b>powerful</b> querying mechanism
based on Perl regular expressions.  Other tools show you usage
for one method, Dependency Finder can show you usage for a
possibly large number of methods at a glance.  One example
that comes to mind is "Show me all calls to any constructor
of this class."  With these other tools, you have to select
each constructor in turn, have the tool generate usage
information for that one, save the results, and aggregate
them somehow later.  I don't know about you, but I have more
important things to do, like fix this bug or write that new
feature.</p>

<p>The web application lets you <b>share</b> a dependency
graph with the whole team.  Everyone can query the graph with
nothing more than their browser and not have to install
anything, or wait after the tools to extract a graph from
code.  The graph is there, all the time, at everyone's
disposal.  You can even have your nightly build regenerate
the graph after each successful compilation run.<p>

<p>Dependency Finder can compute <b>closures</b>, that is,
follow dependencies and find everything reachable from a
given start point.  This helps you package related components
together, and verify that the code respects encapsulation.</p>

<p>And Dependency Finder includes many <b>more</b> tools.
See the <a href="Manual.html">user manual</a> and
<a href="Tools.html">tool list</a> for all it has to offer.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to have a tool, or suite of
tools, that can extract class dependencies from compiled Java
code.  The tools can get all the necessary information out
of the <code>.class</code> files.</p>

<p>Many authors have stressed the importance of managing
depencencies (
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/listArticles?key=author&author=Robert%20C.%20Martin">Robert C. Martin</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633620/o/qid=980962318/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/105-0176284-9920776">John Lakos</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/coupling.pdf">Martin Fowler</a>).
Managing
dependencies means securing encapsulation and making sure
that the code follows the architecture.  It is also
essential for the modularization of code and favors reuse.
By extracting the information from the code itself, we can
detect where we were sloppy, where we took shortcuts that
we shouldn't have.  Managing the dependencies can
shorten the compilation time of the code.</p>

<p>At first, I thought of using the Reflection API, but
it shows only the class's attributes and method signatures.
If a method uses some other class for a local variable or
to call a static method, that dependency that will not
show under the Reflection API.</p>
