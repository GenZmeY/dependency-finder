Fixed =TestSymbolGathererStrategyDecorator= so it tests the right class, and
not one of its descendants.

The fields of =MaximumCapacityPatternCache= were package-level instead of being
private for some reason.  I suspect that a manual refactoring was the cause.  I
made them private and neither the compiler nor the tests complained about it.
