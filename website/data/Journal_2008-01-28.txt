Minor clean up: removing trailing spaces.

There was a feature added to =JProgressBar= in JDK 1.4 where you could put it in
an _indeterminate_ state when you didn't know how long a task would be.  At the
time I wrote =OpenFileAction= and =MetricsExtractAction=, I was still supporting
JDK 1.3, so I commented out the calls to =JProgressBar.setIndeterminate()=.  I
think it is safe to uncomment them now.
