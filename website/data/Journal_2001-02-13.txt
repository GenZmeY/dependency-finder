Added =DirectoryExplorer= and the
=jt.dependencyfinder.model=
package.  The new =DependencyFinder=
tool either prints the _forest of packages_
or the burgeoning <a href="Components.html#xml">XML output</a>.

We may have a problem with inlined code.  Features
marked as =public static final= do not
show up.
