Added =-compact= and =-indent-text= switches to =ClassFinder=.  =-indent-text=
has four spaces as its default value, and it's throwing off the Fit test.

Changed =ClassMatcher= so that it uses the group information from the
=endClassfile= event instead of relying on the group stack maintained by
=LoadListenerBase=.
