Fixed bug where if the scope was reduced to an inferred feature of a confirmed
class, the class and its package ended up unconfirmed in the resulting
sub-graph.  =GraphCopier= and =GraphSummarizer= were using the current node's
confirmation status when copying a node a propagating it to its parent nodes
instead of creating accurate copies of the parent nodes in the first place.
