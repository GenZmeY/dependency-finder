Refactored =SymbolGatherer= to use a Strategy pattern when deciding which
symbols to gather or not.  I want to write a custom strategy for collecting
non-private fields, which I couldn't do with the code before I extracted the
decision-making process into another object.  I'm debating if =SymbolGatherer=
shouldn't use a collection of strategies instead, collecting symbols that
match at least one strategy.
