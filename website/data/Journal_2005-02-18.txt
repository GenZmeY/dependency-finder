Updated the code coverage reports, both jcoverage and Clover.  The
last time went all the way back to July 20, 2003.  The number have
improved a bit but they are still rather laughable.  I added the
procedure for generating them to the Developer Guide.

Upgraded my testing environment from Clover 1.3_01 to 1.3.4.
