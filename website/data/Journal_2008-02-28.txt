Added a very early version of =DependencyGraphToGraphML.xsl=.  It turns out
writing XML from XSLT is a non-issue (as you'd expect).  Just use
=&lt;xsl:output method%5F"xml"/&gt;=, which is kinda the default if the top
result node is not some variation of =&lt;html&gt=, according to the
[[http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt][XSLT spec]].
