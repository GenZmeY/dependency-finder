I fixed the <a target="_blank" href="MinMax.html">minimize and
maximize discussion</a>.  It had broken links and I had to regenerate
the HTML from the source MS Word document.

While I was at it, I fixed the <a href="Documentation.html">Documentation</a>
section too.  It had a few obsolete links.

Someone brought <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdiff/">JDiff</a>
to my attention.  I've given it a cursory look and I still believe
that my work is so much better.  ;-)  More on this later.  I'll have
to create a section on the _competition_.
