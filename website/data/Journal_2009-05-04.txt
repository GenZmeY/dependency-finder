which deals with the signature for a class' static initializer.

I wrote a test (using JUnit 4) which exposed that =Feature_info.getName()= and
=Feature_info.getSignature()= were calling =UTF8_info.toString()= instead of
=UTF8_info.getValue()=, which tripped the mocks created by jMock.  It also
forced me to change the signature of the =Feature_info= constructor to depend
on =DataInput=, an interface, instead of =DataInputStream=, a concrete class.
