I don't know what I was thinking when I first wrote =VisitorDecorator=.  It was
calling the counterpart method on the delegate directly instead of using double
dispatch like I originally wanted to.  I fixed the tests, mocking more things
along the way, and then fixed the code.

Cleaning up the interface, I added =traverseInbound()= and =traverseOutbound()=
to the =Visitor= interface.  Almost all implementations already had them already
and the others ended up being no-ops.
