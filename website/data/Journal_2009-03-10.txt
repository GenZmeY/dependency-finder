Considering moving the behavior from =CodeDifferenceStrategy.isCodeDifferent()=
to =Code_attribute.equals()= instead.  This way, if I introduce a Null Object
pattern for =Code_attribute=, I can make sure that nothing equals the null
object.  And the code in =CodeDifferenceStrategy= would become a simple:

    public boolean isCodeDifferent(Code%5Fattribute oldCode, Code%5Fattribute newCode) {
        return oldCode.equals(newCode);
    }

This assumes that =oldCode= is not null, but all call sites for
=isCodeDifferent()= already check that neither =oldCode= nor =newCode= is null,
so it is perfectly safe.
