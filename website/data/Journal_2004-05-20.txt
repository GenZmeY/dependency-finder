Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Ant</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.6.0</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.6.1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Opened a new
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=957832&group_id=1&atid=200001][trouble ticket]]
with SourceForge.  I haven't been able to contact the CVS
repository for over a week now.
