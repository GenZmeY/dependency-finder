Removed =ConstantPool= from the public interface of =*Annotations_attribute=
components.  The fact that some of them hold on to the constant pool and do
lookup at runtime is an implementation detail.

Fixed =Parameter= so it actually reads its annotations from the byte stream.  I
also simplified its interface to remove the back reference to
=RuntimeParameterAnnotations_attribute=.
