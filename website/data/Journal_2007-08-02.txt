Played with JDK 1.6.  It screwed up some of the tests because of changes in the
language and the =.class= file format.  For instance, there is a new
=StackMapTable= attribute for which I could not find any description on the
Internet.  Of course, the JDK 1.6 compiler puts one such attribute in the
bytecode for =test.main()=.  Right now, Dependency Finder represents it using
=Custom_attribute=, but it threw off
=TestVisitorBase.testVisitCode_attribute()= which wasn't expecting custom
attributes.  The few bits of text I could find on Sun's website that talk
about =StackMapTable= also refer to a =StackMap= attribute, which I had never
heard off before.  Makes me wonder what else is lurking in the shadows.

Since I do most of my Dependency Finder development on a Mac these days, it
will still be a while before I can deal with JDK 1.6 issues.
