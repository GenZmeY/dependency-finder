Added =windowtitle= to =&lt;javadoc&gt;=
target so the Javadocs have a proper window title when viewed with a
browser.

Final clean up for using =logoicon.gif=.

Since October, I've been struggling for a good term to distinguish
nodes in the dependency graph that match elements that were actually
extracted versus those that were merely referenced, but not extracted
per se.  Back on October 08, 2004, I came up with _referenced_
versus _concrete_.  Both are troublesome because they have other
accepted meanings in closely related contexts, such as _concrete class_.
Today, I finally came up with a better replacement:
mere references yield _inferred_ nodes until the matching
element is extracted, at which point the node gets promoted to
_confirmed_.

Made sure that =GraphCopier= and
=GraphSummarizer= maintain a node's confirmed vs. inferred
status across graph copies.
