Back on 2008-11-03, I simplified some constructors at the cost of less useful
debug traces.  I was looking at traces from =ClassMetrics= to see how
Dependency Finder was dealing with annotations in the wild and I realized that
echoing only constant pool indices is not very helpful.  I really need to
look up those values in the constant pool and include them in the trace
message.

Found a bug!  It turns out that the constructor for =AnnotationElementValue=
was not passing the =ConstantPool= to its =Annotation=.  Now that the
constructor for =Annotation= calls =getType()= for its debug trace, it forces
a constant pool look up, which exposed the problem.  Hurray for tests!

I realized that =Annotation= did not expose its =type= property through its
interface.  It is odd that I did not notice it earlier.  And, I must admit, a
bit scary.  What else might I have missed?
