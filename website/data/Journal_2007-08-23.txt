Redesigning the =Classfile= hierarchy is proving more complex than I even
thought.  For now, the easiest thing to do is for me to just add constants with
"illegal" values in the =JarJarDiff= test data folder and write tests that read
=.class= files from the filesystem.  I'll revisit jMock or EasyMock for
something else at some other time.

I modified =ClassReport= to be a =com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor= so I can
use double dispatch to escape string values but not numeric values.  It makes
more sense to have a specific visitor choose the proper rendering based on the
output format than to blindly assume one.  Still, =Report= and =ClassReport=
both join two responsibilities: organizing differences and rendering them in
XML.  These should be split into separate classes, which would open the door to
rendering the reports in something other than XML without the need for XSLT.
