Fixed =CodeDependencyCollector= to correctly track dependencies on annotations.
For now, it only captures dependencies on the annotation itself, not on any
element values that it might contain.  This will come next.

I implemented support for rendering elements of runtime annotations in
=XMLPrinter=.

I also modified =EnumElementValue.getTypeName()= and
=ClassElementValue.getClassInfo()= so they convert class names in path
notation to a proper class name.  Internally, these class names are stored as
UTF-8 strings, not =ClassInfo_attribute= structures, so these classes have to
take care of converting strings containing encoded class names such as
="Lfoo/Bar;"= to proper class names such as ="foo.Bar"=.
