New =AliasSwitch= to handle command-line switches that are simply an alias for
a collection of other switches.  This way, =com.jeantessier.commandline= can
handle aliases and their rendering in usage messages instead of each individual
CLI command.

I refactored the buffer handling in =com.jeantessier.commandline.Printer= to a
new class =com.jeantessier.text.PrinterBuffer=.  Other printers will be able
to use it too to remove code duplication between them.
