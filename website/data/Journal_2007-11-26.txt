Found out Dependency Finder is shipped as part of
[[http://xradar.sourceforge.net][XRadar]].  Cool!

A user contacted me because they are using Dependency Finder from behind a
firewall and the doctype of generated XML documents points to a =SYSTEM= DTD
that they cannot reach.  They suggest using a =PUBLIC= DTD instead.  I will
have to look into how that works and what the implications would be.
