Added hyperlinks on scoped node names in =HTMLPrinter= for the web app so the
user can narrow down the scope to a single package, class, or feature.  It is
not perfect, and sometimes behaves in surprising ways, but it is as good (or
bad) as the hyperlink on dependency names.  Note that each link simply forces
the =scope-includes= field to a certain prefix; it does not change the flags
for what is in scope, whether it's packages, classes, and/or features.

Suppose a display has lots of packages, classes, and features.  Clicking on a
class name reduces the scope to entities that start with the class's name as a
common prefix.  In the resulting display, if you click on the package's name,
it expands the scope back to all entities in that package.
