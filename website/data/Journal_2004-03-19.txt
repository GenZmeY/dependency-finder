Looked at the bug list and feature request list.  It had been a
while.  There was one bug request regarding broken links on the web
site, and two requests for interesting new ways to use JarJarDiff.

It turns out that I had thought of one such way back on August 19,
2003.  The idea is to use a dependency graph to list the parts of a
third party API you are using.  Then feed this list to JarJarDiff to
limit the hange report to the subset that you are really using.  All
the tools are there, it's just a matter of how you use them.  I
scanned my notes and added them to
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=900446&group_id=43305&atid=435887x][feature request #900446]]
until I come up with a formal description.
