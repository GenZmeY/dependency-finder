I want to redo =ClassList= to simply use a =LoadListener= to collect class names
as they are being read in.  Coupled with a lightweight =Classfile=, it would
reduce its memory footprint.  Right now, it uses an =AggregatingClassfileLoader=
and parses an entire JAR completely before simply writing out class names.  This
is a waste of time and memory and it hurts when dealing with really large JAR
files.
