A friend mentioned the [[http://groovy.codehaus.org/][Groovy]] language.  It is
a scripting language built on top of Java.  It compiles to bytecode and runs on
the JVM, so I might be able to run Dependency Finder on it and see what comes
out.  :-)

The Groovy site mentions [[http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/][Cobertura]] to do
code coverage.  Its sample output looks nicer than what I'm using right now:
[[http://www.cenqua.com/clover/][Clover]] and
[[http://emma.sourceforge.net][Emma]].  I'll try to run it over Dependency
Finder when I have a moment.
