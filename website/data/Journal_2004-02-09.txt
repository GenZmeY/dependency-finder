Last November, I nominated Dependency Finder for the 2003 Jolt Award
at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/jolts/">Software Development</a>
magazine.  Today, they announced the finalists.  I'm afraid it didn't
make the cut.  Not that I had high hopes or anything.  It did get a
mention in the magazine after all.
