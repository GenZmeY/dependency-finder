A colleague pointed me to [[http://code.google.com/p/google-depan/][DepAn]],
another dependency analysis tool for Java.  It seems to be built on the Eclipse
platform and uses ASM for decompiling Java bytecode.  It is distributed as a
binary for the Linux platform.  It won't work on my Mac and I couldn't get it
to start on my Linux box either.
