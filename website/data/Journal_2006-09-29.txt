Changed classes in the =com.jeantessier.dependency.Printer= hierarchy to use
separate methods for printing scoped node names from dependency node names.
This lets me put scoped nodes in bold in the HTML output and leave dependency
names in regular font.  I should probably use CSS instead of hard-coding the
bold using =&lt;b&gt;= tags, though.
