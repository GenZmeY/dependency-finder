Cleaned up straggling =-all= switches in sample code in the documentation.

Fixed some of the tools so they can read from standard input:

    * c2c
    * c2p
    * ClassCohesion
    * DependencyClosure
    * DependencyCycles
    * DependencyMetrics
    * DependencyReporter
    * f2f
    * p2p

This way, I can chain them on a command-line so the output of one becomes the
input of the next one, just like typical Unix tools.
