Found a deficiency with
=com.jeantessier.classreader.XMLPrinter=: it
is not printing attributes of class fields.  I opened
a bug about it,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=615616&group_id=43305&atid=435884">bug #615616</a>.

I used the Inherited Behavior design pattern to normalize
the handling of attributes across implementations of the
=com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor= interface.
This solved the bug, but I had to change the DTD for
classfiles.  I don't know how that will impact validity
of outputs once I change it the web site that the tools
point to by default.

I worked out the problem with
=PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl=.  If I use the full
notation for Xalan extensions instead of the abbreviated
one for Java, it works just fine, even with Xalan 2.4.0.
So I will upgrade back to Xalan 2.4.0.  I opened a bug
with the Xalan folks:
