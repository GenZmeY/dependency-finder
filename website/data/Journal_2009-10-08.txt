Fixed the WebWork-based web app, somewhat.  It turns out that if I want to use
Spring IoC, I need to add a few JAR files to the application and an empty
Spring config.  But maybe I just don't need Spring IoC.

Now, the web app starts, but nothing happens when I try to run =extract.action=.
I know the right method gets called because =start= and =stop= get assigned, but
=ExtractAction= does not look at the resources listed in =source=.
