I requested a SourceForge project and had it approved the
same day.  I got SSH to work, but CVS still eludes me.

I'm going to change the licensing.  I'm going to move away
from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>
to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">BSD-style</a>
license.
