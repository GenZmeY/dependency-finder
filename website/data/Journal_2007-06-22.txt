Found a bug with =DependencyExtractor=.  If I don't give it any parameters, it
is supposed to start exploring the current directory.  Instead of that, I am
getting a =UnsupportedOperationException= in =Collection.add()= when the tool
adds "." to the parameters when the parameter list is empty.  I opened a bug
against it:
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1741810&group_id=43305&atid=435884][Bug #1741810]].

This impacts quite a few tools:

    * =ClassFinder=
    * =ClassList=
    * =ClassMetrics=
    * =DependencyExtractor=
    * =ListDeprecatedElements=
    * =ListSymbols=
    * =OOMetrics=

I also found a similar somewhat similar problem with =ClassReader=, but this
tool uses an =AtLeastParameterStrategy= and requires at least one parameter.
So it makes no sense to have a special case for when there are no parameters,
since this will never happen.  I looked at previous versions of the tool and
this duality has been present for a long time, so I kept the
=AtLeastParameterStrategy=.  =ClassReader= is not meant to run against a large
set of classes, it is intended for use against a small set so we can inspect
their internals.
