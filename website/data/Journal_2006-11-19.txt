Refactored =com.jentessier.commandline= to simplify printers for usage and
echo of parsed command-line.  The latter still doesn't echo parameters; it
only does switches at this time.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>IntelliJ IDEA</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>6.0.1</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>6.0.2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
