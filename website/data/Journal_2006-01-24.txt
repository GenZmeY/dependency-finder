Added a new XSL stylesheet, =DiffSymbolsToText.xsl=, to extract symbols from
diff reports generated by =JarJarDiff=.  Someone suggested that they could
use these symbols to start an upstream closure to find which tests would
possibly exercise the modified code.  Apparently, their suites take a very
long time to run and this would allow them to quickly run some regression to
see that they haven't broken anything.  Sounds interesting, I'm curious to
see how it turns out.

=JarJarDiff= currently only lists the names of removed/new packages, classes,
and interfaces, without any of their internal details.  For this trick to
work, maybe it would help if it listed all the classes and features in a
removed package.
