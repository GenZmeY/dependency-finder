Had a discussion with Russ Rufer, Tracy Bialik, and Gene Volovich on my recent
exepriment combining decorator and visitor patterns.  Russ recommended that I
look at the code for [[http://asm.objectweb.org/][ASM]] where he saw a way to
combine visitors and graph traversal that he liked.  This might be inspirational
when I try to apply the same model to =com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor=.

They also suggested that I could migrate Dependency Finder to ASM.  This way, I
wouldn't have to keep up with language developments.  I vaguely remember taking
a glance at ASM some time ago and finding it rather ugly.  Maybe it's worth
another look, if only to properly document why I don't like it.  :-)
