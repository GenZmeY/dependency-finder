Added new experimental "Related links" banner from Google to selected pages on
the website.  It does not pay like Google's AdSense, but it might provide
useful links to people who visit the site.  I added it to the following pages
to start with:

    * Introduction (between main text and quotes)
    * Resources (at the top)
    * Journal (at the top)
