Tried to generate GraphML where class-in-package and feature-in-class
relationships were modeled using subgraphs instead of simple edges, but the
resulting graph didn't look too good in
[[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.htm][yEd]].

For example, take this simple dependency graph:

    p1
        C1
            f1
                --> p2.C2.f2
    p2
        C2
            f2
                <-- p1.C1.f1


Using edges to represent containement, I get this picture:

[[../images/p1.C1.f1_p2.C2.f2_edges.jpg]]

Whereas using subgraphs, I get this picture:

[[../images/p1.C1.f1_p2.C2.f2_subgraphs.jpg]]

Clearly, this second form will not scale to large classes and/or packages.
