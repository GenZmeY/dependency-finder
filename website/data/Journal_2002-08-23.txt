Found some articles
(one by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.PDF">Robert C. Martin</a>)
and a tool for the Resource section.  The article by Mr. Martin
gave me the idea of providing a custom metrics configuration
with the metrics he describes in the article, using the same
abbreviations.  I might need more powerful computational measurements
to handle the equations.

I've put up some <a target="_blank" href="Samples/">sample outputs</a>
so you can see what they looks like.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JUnit</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>3.7</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>3.8</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
