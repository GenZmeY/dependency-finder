Fixed tests broken by new switches to =ListSymbols=.

Streamlined the building of =CLASSPATH= in =junit= and =textjunit= launcher
scripts under Unix.

Switched =textjunit= to use the normal JUnit 4.4 test runner instead of the old
=junit.textui.TestRunner=.

I noticed that the graphical UI launched by =junit= is now broken.  It has most
likely been broken since I switched to the JUnit 4.4 binaries back on
2008-06-09 but I had not noticed.  I might get rid of the graphical launcher
altogether if I cannot find a suitable replacement to
=junit.swingui.TestRunner=.
