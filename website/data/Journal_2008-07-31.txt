Documented the new switches to =ListSymbols= on the the Tools page.

Fixed tests broken by new switches to =ListSymbols=.

Streamlined the building of =CLASSPATH= in =junit= and =textjunit= launcher
scripts under Unix.

Switched =textjunit= to use the normal JUnit 4.4 test runner instead of the old
=junit.textui.TestRunner=.

I noticed that the graphical UI launched by =junit= is now broken.  It has most
likely been broken since I switched to the JUnit 4.4 binaries back on
2008-06-09 but I had not noticed.  I might get rid of the graphical launcher
altogether if I cannot find a suitable replacement to
=junit.swingui.TestRunner=.

Tried to create tests for the Ant version of =ListSymbols=, but the Ant code is
not very testable.  The Ant tasks have many trivial accessors that I do not
want to waste time testing.  The interesting business logic is embeded in the
=execute()= method.  I will need to pull it out before I can write any tests
against it.  I don't know if I should write Fit tests, like I did for the CLI,
or if I should just stick to regular JUnit tests.
