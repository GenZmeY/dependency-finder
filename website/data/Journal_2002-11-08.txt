Found two references to Perl regular expressions in Java.
I will be able to point people to them in the manual and the
JSPs.  This will help with teaching people how to use the
regular expressions to get them data they want.

<ul>
    <li>=<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/org/apache/oro/text/regex/package-summary.html#package_description">org.apache.oro.text.regex</a>= in Jakarta ORO</li>
    <li>=<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">java.util.regex.Pattern</a>= in JDK 1.4</li>
</ul>

I will also write a more decent samples section in the
manual.  The current one is rather laughable.
