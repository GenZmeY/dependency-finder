Someone found a documentation error with =JarJarDiff=.  I documented that the
=-level= switch could take an argument of "code" to show code-level differences
when that's actually the =-code= switch instead.  I will need to fix the
documentation for =JarJarDiff= (both CLI and Ant task) and =ClassClassDiff=.

As I was investigating this, I noticed that the code to select the strategy is
rather convoluted.  This stems in part from me using the Decorator pattern to
implement and combine strategies.  There is a base strategy that can be either
=CodeDifferenceStrategy= or =NoDifferenceStrategy=, according to the =-code=
switch.  This base strategy is wrapped by the strategy specified by the
=-level= switch.  The result is then optionally wrapped one more with a
=ListBasedDifferenceStrategy= if the user used the =-filter= switch.  There
ought to be an easier way to provision an arbitrary stack of strategies, where
the user can specify the strategy at each layer as well as the number of layers
itself.
