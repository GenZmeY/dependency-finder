Cleaned up the command-line validation in Fit tests.

I was hesitating between =check= and =reject= and =ensure= rows, but I came up
with a system.  I use =ensure= rows to show good, valid command-lines and
=reject= to show broken command-lines.  I ended up using =check= for switches
=-echo=, =-help=, and =-version= because while they are allowed command-lines,
they do not lead to running the application but short-circuit it instead.
