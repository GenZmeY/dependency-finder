I made the [[http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/9399][Pivotal Tracker]]
project public so everyone can see how it's doing.

Also, today, I found a
[[https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/index.php?func=detail&aid=2663688&group_id=43305&atid=435884][bug]]
in =ClassReader=.  In text mode, when it encounters an abstract method, it
would throw a =NullPointerException=.  The code in =TextPrinter] blindly calls
=entry.getCode().accept(this)= without checking that =getCode()= returned
something.  I could use the Null Object pattern, but I'll have to check
everywhere I call =getCode()= first.
