Found some references to =StackMap= in the release notes for JDK 1.6.  They
point to [[http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=202][JSR 202]], which itself points
to JSR 030 and [[http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=139][JSR 139]].  It appears
=StackMap= is used to simplify class verification by splitting the process
between the compiler and the runtime.  JSR 139 has the full specification ,so I
will be able to parse it fully in =com.jeantessier.classreader=.
