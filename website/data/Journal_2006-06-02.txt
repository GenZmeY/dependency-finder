Opened a ticket
([[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1499643&group_id%3D1&atid%3D200001][1499643]])
with SourceForge about my commit problem.  Apparently, I am not the only one.
I found at least one other ticket
([[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1499575&group_id%3D1&atid%3D200001][1499575]])
with the same problem and others are also having trouble commiting but get
different error messages.

Fixed my issue with table width in the new webapp pages for dependency cycles.

Found out SourceForge added a new permission on user accounts for Subversion
access.  I granted myself permission but it didn't work right away.  I guess
there is a propagation delay between the user management system and the
permission system.  It's all better now.
