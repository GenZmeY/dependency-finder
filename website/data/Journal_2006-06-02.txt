Opened a ticket
([[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1499643&group_id=1&atid=200001][1499643]])
with SourceForge about my commit problem.  Apparently, I am not the only one.
I found at least one other ticket
([[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1499575&group_id=1&atid=200001][1499575]])
with the same problem and others are also having trouble commiting but get
different error messages.

Fixed my issue with table width in the new webapp pages for dependency cycles.
