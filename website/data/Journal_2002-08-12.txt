I found two other tools that do similar things as
Dependency Finder: <a target="_blank" href="http://remotejava.com/classdep/">classdep</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.headwaysoftware.com/">reView</a>.

Faced with the declining number of downloads of Dependency
Finder recently, I'm going to have to start advertising.  I'm going to
start by spamming newsgroups...  See you in comp.lang.java.*  :-)
