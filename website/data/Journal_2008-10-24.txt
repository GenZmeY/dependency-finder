Added =LoadListenerDecorator= and =ClassfileFilteringLoadListener= to help with
filtering load events to filter certain classes based on regular expressions.
This is the beginning.  The filters extend the decorator so they can be
composed with other =LoadListener= implementations, such as
=LoadListenerVisitorAdaptor= for example.
