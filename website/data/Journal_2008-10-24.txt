Added =LoadListenerDecorator= to help with filtering load events to filter
certain classes based on regular expressions.  This is the beginning.  The
actual filters will extend this class so they can be composed with other
=LoadListener= implementations, such as =LoadListenerVisitorAdaptor= for
example.
