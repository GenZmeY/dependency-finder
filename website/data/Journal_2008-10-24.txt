Added filtering capability for =LoadEvent= listeners.

The hierarchy looks like this:

[[../images/FilteringLoadListenerHierarchy.gif]]

This will help with filtering certain classes based on regular expressions.
The filters extend the decorator so they can be composed with other
=LoadListener= implementations, such as =LoadListenerVisitorAdaptor=, for
example.
